However, the second is traditionally a soft quarter for cement producers from the demand point of view, considering the fact that monsoon hits construction activities.  Revival of retail and institutional demands on the back of receding monsoon and pick up in construction activities owing to lower prices of building raw materials are likely to aid cement companies going ahead.  India’s cement sector profitability (EBITDA/tonne) is expected to bottom out by 2QFY23 and may scale new highs by FY25 as it is likely to pass on most of the cost escalations by then, said Antique Broking in its report.  Antique Broking expects average EBITDA/tonne of companies under its coverage to increase from Rs 970/tonne in FY23E to Rs 1,320/tonne in FY25E. This may be achieved by declining fuel costs, improved demand and higher government infra spend.  We see upside risks to FY24–25E consensus earnings. Our coverage universe’s FY24–25E EBITDA are 10 per cent ahead of consensus,\" it added. \"We prefer north and west regions, which are likely to see minimal capacity additions over FY23–25E.  Antique Broking, overweight on the sector, has upgraded  Shree Cement ,  JK Cement ,  Ramco Cements  to ‘buy’. It has also initiated coverage on Nuvoco Vistas with a ‘hold’ rating. It likes  Ultratech Cement  and  JK Lakshmi Cement , too.  Domestic brokerage firm Axis Securities expects cement volume and revenue to grow by 9 per cent and 14 per cent, respectively, on a year-on-year basis (YoY) owing to better demand and higher realisation.  However, EBITDA and adjusted profit after tax (PAT) are expected to contract sharply by 33 per cent and 50 per cent YoY, respectively, owing to higher costs of power/fuel coupled with lower realisation QoQ, it added.  “We estimate overall cement industry demand to grow between 8 and 9 per cent in FY23, driven by the factors mentioned above,” Axis said. “Higher input costs, particularly fuel prices, have remained to be the major concern for the cement companies.”  Axis Securities prefers  Ambuja Cements  and  Dalmia Bharat  from the large-caps,  JK Lakshmi  and JK Cement from the mid-cap segment and  Star Cement  from the small-cap segment.  Anand Rathi Research picked  Birla Corporation , Ramco Cements, Dalmia Bharat and  Orient Cement .  “Our channel checks suggest industry volumes in September 2022 may report high single-digit MoM growth owing to lower prices of steel and cement, lower rainfall in high-density areas and pick-up in infrastructure projects,” said  ICICI Securities .  On the pricing front, average pan-India prices were flat MoM in September, but up 5 per cent YoY. Healthy volumes during dull season indicate robust volumes in the upcoming season, ICICI Securities added.  ICICI Securities has ‘buy’ call on UltraTech Cement,  ACC , Shree Cement, Nuvoco Vistas, JK Cement and ‘add’ rating on Dalmia Bharat, Ramco Cements, Orient Cement and  Grasim . It only suggests  India Cements  from the pack.  According to Anand Rathi Research, dealers across regions have predicted that demand would be subdued in October owing to festival holidays, leading to labour unavailability and restricted truck movements.  While companies across regions, except in central India, are planning to announce price hikes between Rs 10 and 40 per bag, dealers suggest they would sustain despite weak demand.  The brokerage firm prefers  Birla Corporation , Ramco Cement, Dalmia Bharat and Orient Cement. “Weak demand persists in central India. This is a key reason restricting companies from price hikes.”   (Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views, and opinions given by the experts are their own.

Besides, it has also advised shareholders to vote against the appointment of Ameet Desai and Purvi Sheth as independent directors of the company.    Ambuja Cements, which also owns 50.05 per cent in  ACC Ltd , has called an Extra Ordinary General Meeting (EGM) of the shareholders on Saturday.    It has sought shareholders' approval on 12 resolutions, which include preferential allotment of 47.74 crore warrants at a price band of Rs 418.87 to Harmonia Trade and Investment Ltd, an  Adani group  entity, totalling Rs 20,001 crore in one or more tranches.    The company has also sought approvals for the appointment of Adani Group chairman Gautam Adani, his son  Karan Adani  and two directors and four independent directors on the board.    In its voting advisory, IiAS has said: \"Assuming full conversion of the warrants, the issue will lead to a dilution of 19.4 per cent on the expanded capital base which is high. Promoter shareholding will increase to 70.3 per cent from the current 63.1 per cent.\"    Moreover, the issue price is at a 16.3 per cent discount to the current market price of Rs 500.2 and at an 8.8 per cent premium to the acquisition price from the Holcim Group.    The advisory firm said Ambuja Cements already had a cash and cash equivalent balance of Rs 3,840 crore on a standalone basis and Rs 8,500 crore on a consolidated basis.    It understands the rationale for the capital infusion, given the substantial capex plans of the company.    \"Notwithstanding, we do not favour preferential issue of warrants to promoters since it gives promoters the option to ride the stock price for 18 months. Subsequently, if the promoters decide not to subscribe to the remaining 75 per cent, it could have material implications for the company's long-term plans. We do not encourage warrants to promoters and rather all the money be brought in upfront,\" it said.    The voting advisory also asked shareholders to vote against the appointment of Ameet Desai as an independent director. Desai, who had held various positions with Adani Group, did not have a cooling-off period.    While for Purvi Sheth, the report said she serves on the boards of four listed companies and is also the managing director at Shilputsi Consultants. Therefore, her high number of directorships on listed companies are not in keeping with the spirit of the regulation, it added.    Last month Adani Group announced the completion of the acquisition of Ambuja Cements and  ACC  for a total consideration of USD 6.5 billion, which includes the buyout of Swiss major Holcim's stake in the two firms and subsequent open offers to minority shareholders.    Days after the acquisition, Adani group had pledged his entire stake in Ambuja Cements & ACC Ltd worth USD 13 billion to the Hong Kong Branch of Deutsche Bank.    Adani had acquired  Ambuja Cement  and ACC through Mauritius-based SPV Endeavour Trade and Investment Limited (ETIL), which is owned by Xcent Trade and Investment Ltd (XTIL)."},

Agencies  Domestic brokerage firm  Motilal Oswal  is bullish on the cement industry dynamics over the next few years, due to better demand prospects, led by infrastructure and housing sector, increased consolidation in the industry, and regulatory changes in the allotment of limestone blocks.  Over the next three-years, the brokerage expects a demand CAGR of approximately 8 per cent, which is likely to surpass installed capacity CAGR of 5.4 per cent.   ICICI Securities  said assuming fuel prices sustain at current levels (or correct further) coupled with price hikes /current price hike absorption, risk-reward is expected to turn favourable in the medium-term perspective as margins or consensus earnings downgrade has likely bottomed out.

From Covid-19 lows, India Cements has delivered a handsome return of 225 per cent to investors.  Cement stocks  have been on the radar considering the government's infra push and acquisition of  Ambuja Cements  and  ACC  by Adani Group.  Analysts said the twin acquisitions by Adani have raised hopes of more such deals in the sector as a few players are finding it difficult to pare their leverage and may be willing to exit the cement business at good valuations.  Domestic brokerage  Motilal Oswal  said, “A consolidation in the industry, if it occurs, will boost pricing power, synergies in the form of cost reduction and operational efficiency; and cross-branding, which will help expand market reach.”  The December 2022 quarter could see benefits from lower fuel prices, while January-June 2023 could see both better cement demand and prices in a seasonally strong period,\" said Krupal Maniar, Analyst, Antique Stock Broking.

In  Ambuja  Cement, 7.27 lakh shares were tendered which is 0.14% of the 51.64 crore shares Adani offered to buy. Shareholders refrained from tendering their shares in Ambuja because the open offer price was below the stock price. In the case of ACC, the offer price was at a modest premium to the stock price.

The S&P BSE Sensex closed with losses of more than 200 points but managed to hold on to 60,000 on a closing basis, which is a positive sign.

Here's what Rahul Goud, Research Analyst - Equity Research, CapitalVia Research, recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:   Fortis Healthcare: Buy Fortis Healthcare is an integrated healthcare delivery service provider, involved in creating and running hospitals, diagnostic facilities, and research facilities.  Given the increasing case mix in the hospital segment and attempts to reduce costs, we anticipate improved margins across all categories.  Technically, equities have shown a breakout from a tight range with volume, and the momentum indicator MACD also points to a bullish outlook for the stock.  Traders can purchase stock at the current market price of Rs 307 with a stop loss of Rs 296 and a short-term target price of Rs 325.   Allcargo Logistics: Buy  Offering integrated logistics solutions is what Allcargo Logistics does. Revenue has expanded at a yearly rate of 29.22 per cent for the past five years, compared to the industry average of 9.69 per cent, while the market share increased from 13.51 per cent to 27.82 per cent during that time.  Technically, the stock has been trading in a downward trend since January 2022, but on Wednesday, it broke out of that channel with strong volumes.  The stock can be bought at the current market price of Rs 438 with a stop loss of Rs 415 and a mid-term target price of Rs 500.   Ambuja Cements: Avoid On the back of a fund-raising scheme, Ambuja Cements witnessed strong buying action on Wednesday. On September 9, 2022, the open offer by the Adani family to buy a further 26% share in  ACC  and Ambuja Cements expired.  A 54.53 per cent stake in ACC is held by Ambuja Cements. Technically, the stock has risen too much and thus, we advise investors to avoid it at this time.   (Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

He saw a multifold rise in cement demand in India on the back of record-breaking economic growth and the government's infrastructure creation push, which will give significant margin expansion.    In a speech made at an event to mark the completion of the acquisition on September 17, the Adani Group founder and chairman said the ports-to-energy conglomerate has in a single stroke become the second largest cement manufacturer in the country.    Adani Group last week completed buyout of Swiss major Holcim's stake in the two firms.    Calling the acquisition historic, he said this buyout is India's largest ever inbound M&A transaction in the infrastructure and materials space and closed in a record time of 4 months.    \"Our entry into this business is happening at a time when India is on the cusp of one of the greatest economic surges seen in the modern world,\" he said in the speech, which was released on Monday.    Stating reasons for the foray into the cement space, he said while India is the second largest producer of cement in the world, its per capita consumption is just 250 kg compared to 1,600 kg of China. \"This is almost a 7x headroom for growth.\"    Also, \"as several of the government's programmes gather momentum, the long-term average growth in cement demand is expected to be 1.2 to 1.5 times the GDP. We anticipate growing at twice this number,\" he said.    With trillion-dollar investment planned in infrastructure and housing in the country, cement is an attractive \"adjacency to our infrastructure business, especially the group's ports and logistics business, green energy business, and the e-commerce platform being developed,\" he said.    Adani Group's competency in driving operational efficiency will result in \"significant margin expansion to become the most profitable cement manufacturer in the country,\" he said. \"And we anticipate going from the current 70 million tonne capacity to 140 million tonne in next 5 years.\"    On his group's growth philosophy, Adani, 60, said it is the belief in India's growth story.    India will be a USD 25-30 trillion economy by 2050, which points to huge growth prospects, he said.    The group is the world's largest solar power company and has committed USD 70 billion investment in clean energy business including green hydrogen, he said.    Adani Group is the largest airport operator in the nation with 25 per cent of passenger traffic and 40 per cent of air cargo. It is the largest ports and logistics company in the country with a 30 per cent market share.    \"We are India's largest integrated energy player spanning generation, transmission, distribution, LNG, LPG, city gas and piped gas distribution. Each of these businesses is growing at double-digit rates,\" he said.    While the group has won some of the largest road contracts in the country and is on the way to becoming the largest player in this sector, a grand IPO of  Adani Wilmar  has made it the highest-valued FMCG company in the country.    \"We have declared our path forward in multiple new sectors that include data centers, super apps, aerospace and defence, industrial clouds, metals, and petrochemicals,\" he said.    \"Our finances are stronger than ever before, and we continue to raise billions of dollars from international markets and strategic partners to further accelerate our growth.\"    Adani Group's market cap, he said, stands at USD 260 billion - having grown faster than any company ever in India, he added."},

Analysts said the twin acquisitions by Adani have raised hopes of more such deals in the sector.  Shares of Nuvoco Vistas surged 11% to Rs 446.3, while Chennai-based  India Cements  gained 9% to Rs 289.9.  Kesoram Industries ,  Mangalam Cement ,  Sanghi Industries , and  Gujarat Sidhee Cement  jumped over 5% each. Ambuja Cement shares also gained 9.3% to Rs 564.9.  The anticipation of bigger acquisitions in the industry is driving the valuation re-rating of regional and smaller players, which are trading at a discount to replacement cost,\" said Gautam Duggad, head of research,  Motilal Oswal Financial Services . \"A few players are finding it difficult to pare their leverage and may be willing to exit the cement business at good valuations.  Days after completing a $6.5-billion buyout of Ambuja Cement and ACC, the new management announced it's targeting an installed capacity of 140 mtpa (Million Tonne Per Annum) over the next five years. The Adani group forayed into the cement business by acquiring Holcim's stake in Ambuja Cement and ACC with a combined grinding capacity of 68 mtpa.  Immediate target companies for Adani could be in regions where it has relatively lower market share, to ensure faster approvals from the Competition Commission of India,\" Devesh Agarwal, analyst,  IIFL Securities . \"Organic expansion is likely to be constrained by other challenges, such as long gestation periods of greenfield projects, costly new limestone mining lease, capacity constraints of equipment suppliers.  Many regional cement players have not added capacities over the last few years and they have lost market share. Analysts said the replacement cost of cement plants is in $100-120 per tonne range. Acquisition of a cement company has been historically at $106-151 per tonne. Many mid- and small-sized companies are trading at an enterprise value per tonne of $48-87. Historically, a valuation premium is assigned to assets based on their ability to generate cash flows and their market presence or operational efficiency.  The overall outlook for the cement sector is also expected to improve in the coming months as the earnings downgrade cycle is likely to bottom out with September 2022 quarter earnings, said analysts.  The December 2022 quarter could see benefits from lower fuel prices, while January-June 2023 could see both better cement demand and prices in a seasonally strong period,\" said Krupal Maniar, analyst, Antique Stock Broking.

Two entities linked to the Adani Group - Endeavour Trade and Investment and Xcent Trade and Investment - are part of the agreement with the Hong Kong office of  Deutsche Bank . Endeavour is the entity through which the Adani Group acquired a stake in Holderind Investments, which is a holding company for Holcim's stake in the two cement makers.  The Adani Group has been expanding aggressively into sectors as diverse as renewable energy, metals and cement, with a bulk of it being funded through debt.   The expansion has resulted in a meteoric rise in the stock prices of listed Adani Group companies, catapulting chairman  Gautam Adani  to the list of the richest people on the planet.  For the acquisition of Ambuja Cements and its subsidiary ACC, Adani raised $4.50 billion (₹35,879 crore) from 14 international banks, the company said in a statement. The acquisition has made the Adani Group the second-largest cement maker in the country, just behind Aditya Birla Group's  UltraTech Cement .  Following the acquisition, the conglomerate on Friday also announced the infusion of ₹20,000 crore in Ambuja Cements, hinting at the group's aggressive plan to enhance capacity through de-bottlenecking, greenfield facilities and acquisition.  Group chairman Adani stated on Monday that he plans to take the cement makers' combined manufacturing capacity to 140 million tonnes per annum by 2030 from 70 million tonnes at present. "},

The foreign research house iterates that “ACC+ACEM have combined capacity of 68mtpa, which should move to 80mtpa by F24, assuming current expansion plans are on track. Deals over the past few years have materialized at an average of Rs 6,500/ton – assuming the same cost of setting up a new plant/deal value going forward; Rs 20,000 crore capital could drive 31mtpa additional capacity, taking ACC+ACEM's combined capacity to 111mtpa”.  That said, the entity is of the view that “commissioning of new capacity and normalization of utilization levels from new capacity takes time (overall 4-5 years), and hence there would be a limited impact on industry utilization rates in the medium term”.  As for the implications of the fund infusion plan, Morgan Stanley noted that the change in promoters and organic/inorganic expansion could pave the way for improved margins over time, led by various cost synergies and operating leverage opportunities. But we need to wait and see how that plays out, it added.  Over the next couple of years, however, ACC+ACEM's volume growth will lag larger peers given the high starting point of capacity utilization rates for them. Moreover, current cost structures for both ACC and ACEM will keep medium-term profitability in check”.  Morgan Stanley further added that ACC and Ambuja shares have outperformed peers YTD and current valuations are not cheap relative to peers, limiting any re-rating triggers and hence upside potential.  It maintained underweight ratings on both ACC and Ambuja.  Giving a holistic view of the sector as a whole and the impact of the recent Adani deal, Morgan Stanley is net positive on the industry in the medium term. The firm adds that unlike in the earlier upcycle of 2010, this time capacity addition is largely concentrated with larger players, which lowers the risk of unjustified capacity additions and thereby price wars.

The brokerage believes cement demand has increased by high single-digit YoY on a base of 6% YoY in 2QFY22. This implies a three-year CAGR of 6-8%, it said.  CLSA’s channel checks suggest that cement prices are down 3- 6% quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) across regions, slightly higher than normal seasonality. Price declines have been greater in North and Central India compared to other regions, it said, adding that there has been some attempt to raise prices in November.  “The demand outlook and price increase post festive season (end October) would be key to watch for. Over the medium term, with utilisations remaining low, the price increase would be difficult to come by despite increasing consolidation. UltraTech (O-PF) is our preferred pick given its return accretive growth,” CLSA added.    (Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views, and opinions given by the experts are their own.

However, net profit  growth  may moderate to single-digit levels as  earnings  slow at some  companies  in the oil and gas, automobiles, metals, and pharma sectors. According to ETIG estimates, the sample's revenue is expected to grow 18.8% from the year earlier while net profit may increase 5%.  Stocking up of goods before the festive season may help top line growth, going by the GST and advance tax collections, said Deepak Jasani, retail research head,  HDFC  Securities.  The September quarter results could bring in a moderate rise in top line year-on-year and sequential basis,\" he said, while indicating that profitability will be tricky to forecast considering the inflation factor.  Second-quarter earnings will be led by the banking and finance, consumer, and automobile sectors and dragged down by commodity sectors such as metals and oil and gas, said Gautam Duggad, institutional research head,  Motilal Oswal Financial Services . \"We expect companies in our coverage universe and  Nifty earnings  excluding metals and oil and gas to post a 30% year-on-year growth in the September quarter,\" he said.  According to ETIG estimates, the sample's operating margin is likely to shrink by 290 basis points year-on-year to 18.4% following high input cost inflation.    Areas of Concern    On the positive side, there may be a 50 basis point improvement in margins from the previous quarter, reflecting the effect of softening commodity prices. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  In the coming quarters, analysts expect demand to improve amid concerns over expectations of a recession in the western economies, the rupee depreciating further against the dollar and rising domestic interest rates.  We expect healthy corporate earnings momentum to continue. India's interest rate and currency management has been very strong compared with global central banks,\" Duggad said, while highlighting elevated crude oil prices and escalation in geopolitical tensions as concern areas.  Jasani expects another round of minor downgrades in the Nifty 50 earnings per share after the second-quarter results season as analysts cut back aggressive projections of profit growth due to raw material inflation effect.   Sector Outlook    Automobiles   It will be a mixed bag for the auto sector. The passenger car companies will post superior earnings growth thanks to the low base effect and a slight margin improvement.  Maruti Suzuki 's volume grew 42% year-on-year while M&M and  Tata Motors  both were among those showing the highest quarterly passenger vehicle volumes. However, muted domestic and export demand may curb earnings growth of two-wheeler companies barring  Eicher Motors .   Banking, finance   The September quarter was marked by better retail and small and medium enterprise (SME) credit offtake while deposit growth remained muted. Since private banks have a higher proportion of repo rate-linked loans, further increases in the policy rate are expected to benefit their net interest margins more than public sector banks. Asset quality is expected to be stable.   Cement   For the September 2022 quarter, large cement companies are likely to focus on volume growth given high input costs. Revenues of  Ultratech Cement ,  ACC ,  Ambuja Cements ,  Shree Cement  and Dalmia Bharat are likely to grow 11-14% year-on-year. Net profit may increase 15-20% because of effective cost management and the low base effect.   FMCG   FMCG companies are expected to show value-led revenue growth for the September quarter as volume growth will be muted amid higher product prices. Despite the easing of commodity prices, the companies have not passed on the benefit to consumers in a bid to protect margins.   InfoTech   A sharp drop in the pound and the euro of 5-6% sequentially against the dollar will likely offset the benefit of over 3% decline in the rupee against the dollar, thereby affecting the revenue growth of IT exporters. Management commentary on deal momentum, employee attrition, and forex management will be crucial.   Metals   Metal companies including ferrous and base metals are expected to report a sharp drop in earnings sequentially and year-on-year amid a fall in prices. While this will impact realisations, higher raw material costs will hurt margins.   Oil & Gas   The energy sector continued to face headwinds in the September quarter. The benchmark Singapore gross refining margin (GRM) fell sharply while petrol spreads turned negative. In addition, the growth of upstream companies was capped by windfall levies. The marketing loss on retail fuel for oil marketing companies has started moderating.   Pharma   Pharma companies are likely to post a modest performance for the quarter. There has been an easing in input cost pressures, helping with margins. The performance of India and emerging markets is expected to compensate for the price erosion in the US market.   "},
