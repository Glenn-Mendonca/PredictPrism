But none has made more money than Adinath Textiles.  The stock has rallied a mind-numbing 4,800 per cent year to date. It is the best performing listed name on BSE. It has hit the upper circuit limit every day for the past 74 sessions.   Problem is, the bull run on the counter seems to be a blind one. The company’s name may have 'textile' in it, but it would be foolish to think it is a beneficiary of the positive environment for the sector. Why, you ask? Adinath has not woven a single strand of yarn in the last two financial years.  The company used to be a textile firm, with “an installed capacity of 4.800 spindles” and state-of-the-art machinery from Italy and France. But its machinery has been gathering dust for the past two years.  “Due to no job work orders and accumulating losses, the company discontinued operations in the financial year 2019-20. Therefore, there was no revenue from operations during the financial year 2020-21,” the company management wrote in its latest annual report.

Even before that, when it was running the mill, the firm recorded a top line of only around Rs 1 crore for a financial year, with the bottom line in the red.   But the company has apparently found another way to generate income.  “In order to supplement its income, the company has given its vacant factory buildings on lease for warehousing purposes,” the management said. Other income of the company, including the income from the lease, during FY21 stood at Rs 1.69 crore compared with Rs 1.39 crore reported for the previous year; a growth of 22 per cent.    So, is this growth fueling the rally in its shares? Very unlikely. No analyst tracks the stock, nor is anyone willing to talk about it. The company is yet to respond to queries sent on its official email address.  The most likely reason for the spurt in the stock price is a possible pump and dump scheme or price manipulation by a few traders to attract gullible retail investors. Though this is extremely difficult to verify.   The company is majority owned by retail investors. As per the latest available data, over 22,000 individual investors held 51.21 per cent stake in the firm. High networth investors held 1.98 per cent. There is hardly any institutional ownership.  The stock is part of the XT group, where only delivery trades can happen. Volumes remain in a few thousand transactions daily with some occasional burst when lakhs of shares change hands.  The rally is a recent trend. Throughout its existence on the bourses, the stock never traded in double digits. But now it has hit a high of Rs 83.80 as of Thursday, from Rs 1.71 at the beginning of the year. "},

This trend is akin to the frenzy witnessed during the dotcom boom of 2000, which saw many dud companies in the sector rally to abnormally high levels on speculative activity. A decade later shares of mining, trading or export companies were targeted by the operators. Many small investors were lured to invest in a large number of penny stocks only to find their hard-earned money taken away by smart operators, many a time acting in connivance with the unscrupulous promoters.  The current boom phase, it appears, is no exception to the victimising tendency prevalent among small gullible investors. There are indications that they may have been chasing penny shares of fundamentally weak companies, thereby risking their investment.   An analysis of the trading pattern in the current market shows share prices of many lesser-known or unknown companies have spurted to unprecedented levels even though their fundamentals hardly inspire any confidence. Many such examples figure on the list of the stocks that have consistently been hitting 52-week highs on  BSE . The abnormal gains, however, have prompted the exchange to keep some of them under surveillance, signalling caution to investors.   It is imperative to mention here that none of the companies covered in this article have so far been subjected to any major regulatory investigation whatsoever for the trading patterns seen in their stocks. The sharp gains could have been the outcome of normal trading practice without a possibility of any foul play by the entities related or unrelated to the respective companies. Some possibilities such as restructuring of operations, capital reduction, change in management, turnaround hopes could have been the triggers behind the spurt in valuations.  While these triggers may have their merit, they hardly justify precariously high valuations in some of the cases.  Leading the pack of penny-turned-multi-bagger stocks is one Adinath Textiles, which BSE classifies as a textiles company. The stock scaled a 52-week high of Rs 101.7 on September 29, 2021, translating into a whooping 100 times returns over its 52-week low price of Rs 1.24 hit on November 18, 2020. Now look at the company’s fundamentals. The figures are far from impressive; it has reported absolutely no sales for the last two consecutive financial years and also for the June quarter of this year. All that it could a boast of was a meagre other income and net profit.   According to the BSE data, Adinath Textiles posted a net profit of Rs 32 lakh on other income of Rs 1.7 crore for FY 2020-21. This year's performance is nothing significant to write home about, with the figures of Rs 23 lakh and Rs 54 lakh respectively for the quarter ended June 30, 2021. These figures hardly vouch for the multi-bagger status of the stock, which is currently quoting at an extraordinary PE (price/earnings ratio) of 134 times on the BSE. The BSE has categorised Adinath Textiles as ‘GSM:Stage 2’ company, which is as per Sebi’s Graded Surveillance Measures (GSM) aimed at alerting investors to be extra cautious while dealing in shares of the companies under surveillance.   Bombay Wire Ropes is another high PE company without any sales to its credit. Classified as an iron and steel products company by BSE, its shares hit a 52-week high of Rs 70.90 on September 29, 2021, a staggering 36 times gain in less than nine months from its 52-week low of Rs 1.98 recorded on January 8, 2021. Such huge returns appear unrealistic given the poor fundamentals of the company. With PE multiple of 1,336 times, the current valuation appears too much for too small a company. Bombay Wire Ropes reported a net profit of Rs 15 lakh on other income of Rs 45 lakh for FY 2020-21. It has an equity capital of Rs 53 lakh of which 64 per cent is held by the promoters, according to the BSE records. Bombay Wire Ropes is also categorized as “GST-Stage 2’ stock.  Proseed India is another example of multi-bagger stock where the company has not reported any sales consistently for last many quarters. The IT software products company, however, earned a net profit of Rs 12.7 crore during the year ended March 31, 2021, which was on account of some extraordinary income as reported to BSE. The stock hit the 5 per cent upper circuit limit to scale a new 52-week high at Rs 103.35 on September 30, 2021, a staggering 382 times returns in less than a year. The company has undergone corporate insolvency process under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code as part which the NCLT approved its resolution plan recently. Accordingly, its equity capital is reduced to Rs 31 lakh from Rs 9.61 crore. Proseed India is classified as ‘IRP:Stage 2’ company on the BSE website.   These few companies represent a large universe of penny-turned-multibagger stocks that are mushrooming amid extremely positive sentiment on the bourses. Investment in such stocks could expose retail investors to the risk of losing capital if they are highly manipulated. In fact, investors have already started bearing the brunt of their unwise decisions as reflected in share price movements in last few days of bearish market.   Adinath Textiles has been trading at lower circuit of 5 per cent with no buyers on the counter for last two consecutive days while trading is restricted in Bombay Wire Ropes with effect from September 30, 2021 as part of GSM action, according to the BSE website.  Stocks of fundamentally weak companies are generally classified as T and Z group on the BSE. The grouping is done on certain qualitative and quantitative parameters. The T group consists of the stocks settled on a trade-to-trade basis as a surveillance measure while the Z group includes companies which have failed to comply with BSE listing requirements and mandatory regulatory compliances. The T and Z group stocks are subjected to strict surveillance measures.   Their intra-day movement is mostly restricted to 5 per cent circuit filter, which is the maximum limit within which share price can move upward or downward in a single day. Besides, investors are required to take compulsory delivery of the shares under the 5 per cent circuit filter and no intra-day squaring off positions is allowed.   This makes difficult for small investors to exit when an operator in a highly manipulative stock goes on a selling spree after the price spurts to a certain level. The share price keeps hitting a lower circuit consistently for many days due to absence of buyers, causing huge loss to the trapped investors.   There have been many cases where the stock exchanges have suspended trading in penny-turned-multibagger shares for non-adherence to the rules and regulations pertaining to insider trading, mandatory compliances relating to filing of quarterly results, audited accounts and shareholding pattern, payment of listing fees etc. The errant among such companies have shown a tendency not to oblige, resulting in the indefinite suspension of trading and loss of the entire capital for investors. This should act as a deterrent for prospective investors against taking unsolicited calls in the current market.   (Vijay Gurav is a freelance market writer. Views are his own.)  "},

Over the past 17 months, the central bank of the world’s largest economy has pumped in trillions of dollars into the US economy that helped avoid a financial catastrophe along with the health crisis that engulfed the world in March 2020.  Fed’s $120 billion a month asset purchases, however, also fuelled a major part of the current bull market in global and Indian equities since the initial crash last year. The Nifty50 index has more than doubled since March 2020, while the broader market indices have trebled.  That said, the Fed will start reducing its bond-buying activity from this year, but will continue to maintain its accommodative stance to ensure further growth in the US economy. However, with liquidity slowly drying up in global and domestic equities in the coming months, markets could see higher  volatility .  In the previous instance when the US Fed started tapering its balance sheet back in 2013,  cash-rich companies  were among the first to recover after the initial sell-off back.

Sectorally, buying was seen in telecom, consumer durables, IT, finance, and FMCG stocks while some selling was seen in auto and capital goods stocks.  Stocks that were in focus include  Adani Power  which rose 5 per cent,  Deepak Fertilisers  which hit a 52-week high and closed with gains of over per cent, and  Apollo Tyres  which rose more than 4 per cent.   Here's what Akhilesh Jat, Category Manager - Equity Research, CapitalVia Global Research recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:   Adani Power: Buy at Rs 381| Stop Loss Rs 368| Target Rs 400  Shares price of Adani Power closed in the green for the sixth consecutive session. During the session, the stock prices hit a fresh all-time high of Rs 380.45. The stock has risen over 281% on NSE in the calendar year 2022, so far.  The stock is trading in higher-highs and higher-low formation and can be seen trading in a rising channel on broader charts.   Deepak Fertilisers: Avoid  After several days of volatility, the share price of Deepak Fertilisers stayed in the green for the second day in a row and surpassed the previous all-time high.  The primary trend of the stock is bullish, however, negative divergence in RSI and Gravestone Doji formation at the top show trend reversal, so at this juncture, one should avoid fresh entry into this stock.   Apollo Tyres: Buy at 262| Stop Loss Rs 252| Target Rs 278  Shares price of Apollo Tyres continued its positive momentum for the fourth straight session. The stock has rallied over 18 per cent in August 2022 so far to hit a fresh 52-week high.   MACD on the Daily chart crossed the Zero Line with a positive crossover which indicates it may continue its upward trend. Breakout of the immediate resistance level of Rs 262 may lead big bull run in the near term.   (Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

The S&P BSE Sensex rose nearly 400 points while the Nifty50 closed above the crucial resistance placed around 17800 levels.  Sectorally, buying was seen in auto, realty, oil & gas, consumer discretionary, power, and utilities while some selling was visible in telecom and metal stocks.  Stocks that were in focus include  Apollo Tyres  which was up 6 per cent,  Solar Industries  which gained over 4 per cent, and  Adani Enterprises  which hit a fresh 52-week high and closed with gains of nearly 4 per cent on Tuesday.    Here's what Jatin Gohil, Technical and Derivative Research Analyst at  Reliance  Securities recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:   Apollo Tyres: Buy  For the week ended 5th Aug’22, the stock witnessed a breakout from a bullish flag pattern and extended gains. It rose to a 17-month high of Rs 258 subsequently.  The key technical indicators are positively poised on long-term as well as medium-term timeframe charts, while short-term indicators tested the overbought zone.  Overall set-up is bullish, but short-term consolidation or a decline cannot be ruled out before the stock resumes its up move.  Hence, a fresh long position can be initiated at the current juncture and further on dips towards Rs 240 for the desired action. The stock has the potential to move towards Rs 280-300-350 in the medium term.  In case of any decline, the stock will find support around the Rs 220-210 zone, which coincides with its extended upper band of the flag and also, with its key moving averages.   Solar Industries India : Book Profit  On 4th Aug’22, the stock gave a breakout from a narrow range (Rs 2,930-2,620) consolidation and later, with the help of a follow-up move, it recorded a new life-time-high of Rs 3,349.  Since the breakout, the volume remained above average for major trading sessions. We believe that undergoing positive momentum could take the stock towards the Rs 3,450-3,550 zone.  In the past, the stock has witnessed short-term volatility after recording a new high amidst profit booking and later remained sideways for a couple of weeks.  Due to such a sudden rise, the key technical indicators tested the overbought zone on the short-term timeframe chart, and soon, they may reverse.  Hence, it is safe to book profit when the stock moves toward the expected levels (Rs 3,450-3,550). On the lower side, as per the change in polarity principle, the stock will find support around its upper band of the range (Rs 2,930).   Adani Enterprises: Hold  For the quarter ended Dec’20, the stock crossed its long-term supply zone (placed at around Rs 450) and later witnessed a strong rise.  Since then, the stock has explored uncharted territory and rose to Rs 2,986. The stock has witnessed a money multiplier up-move, as it rose by more than 500 per cent from the breakout point.  Historically, the stock remained sideways for at least 3-5 months after witnessing a rise for straight four quarters.  The stock registered a ~36 per cent gain so far in this quarter, which is the fourth in a row. If history repeats itself, undergoing positive momentum may slow down after 5-7 weeks.  Later, the stock may witness a short-term decline due to profit booking. In the meanwhile, the stock will keep exploring uncharted territory, which could take it towards Rs 3,040-3,250-3,350.  The risk-to-reward ratio is not favourable for a fresh long position at this juncture. However, one can hold the existing longs by trailing the stop loss.

The money manager sold over 4 crore shares of NTPC, which generates electricity, at the time when the country is reeling under shortage of power. The stock rallied sharply in April but has seen some selling recently.  The stock, however, remains a strong buy candidate as analysts see it reaping rewards amid the energy crisis and a hot summer.

Selling sprees in US retailers  Walmart  and Targets sent global stocks into tailspin earlier this week. But back home, as many as 130-odd BSE 500 companies including many cement, tyre, paints and consumer staples companies have also reported at least 100 per cent drop in PAT margin, data suggests. Management commentaries are full of \"near term pressure\" and \"cost control measures\".   For example, tyre makers such as  CEAT ,  MRF  and  Apollo Tyres  saw a surge in input cost eating into margins.  CEAT reported a 565 basis points drop in PAT margins at 0.68 per cent in the March quarter from 6.34 per cent in the year-ago quarter, as per data available with AceEquity. Ebitda margin shrank 418 basis points to 7.2 per cent, thanks to higher crude and rubber prices.  Margins continue to be under pressure due to rising commodity prices and other inflationary costs,” MD Anant Goenka said in the results note.  Peers Apollo Tyres and MRF saw 370-380 basis points YoY fall in PAT margin. MRF 's gross margin in fact fell 640 basis points YoY (130 bps QoQ) to 32.1 per cent.  Motilal Oswal  noted that despite best efforts, the MRF management has been unable to fully recover the increase in raw material cost.   Paints companies such as  Asian Paints  and  Kansai Nerolac  also witnessed a steep decline in margins. Asian Paints' gross margin fell 448 basis points to 38.7 per cent while Nerolac’s gross margin declined 663 basis points to 27.9 per cent during the quarter.  Antu Thomas of  Geojit Financial Services  noted paint companies have already taken a price hike of nearly 20 per cent due to inflationary pressure on raw material costs. In addition to that, Asian Paints took a 2 per cent price hike from April-May and expects more price hikes in June quarter.  We expect the demand trend may have an impact in the near term on account of a steep rise in prices,\" Thomas said.  Asian Paints' PAT margin fell 202 basis points to 10.96 per cent and Kansai's 720 basis points to 1.24 per cent.  In the FMCG segment,  Nestle India  saw gross margin pressure falling 310 basis points YoY and 160 bps sequentially to 55.4 per cent, which was a 19-quarter low. PAT margin fell 1.74 per cent to 14.94 per cent. We believe near-term raw material headwinds will keep margins under pressure. We maintain hold and rolled over our estimates to March 2024 with a revised  target  of Rs 18,300 from 18,600 earlier,\" Axis Securities said.  PAT margin basis for FMCG firm  Dabur India  fell 430 basis points YoY to 11.74 per cent. CEO Mohit Malhotra said flexibility of passing on this entire inflation in terms of price increases is there but this will only tell on the volume.  And therefore, we are kind of pushing back, not really taking very heavy price increases and waiting for competitors to take price increases before we take price increases. So, that's why there could be near term pressure on the margins because of this,\" he said in Dabur Earnings call.  Cement makers  Ambuja Cements  and ACC also saw 4-5 percentage points drop in March quarter PAT margin.  Star Cement  saw 169 basis points YoY drop in Q4 PAT margin to 11.80 per cent.  Many auto and auto component companies such as  Hero MotoCorp , Bharat Forge,  Ashok Leyland , Atul,  Castrol India ,  Endurance Technologies ,  Escorts ,  Exide Industries  also saw steep drop in PAT margins.  The concerns that have been weighing on the markets since then start of the year related to inflationary pressure and tightening by the global central banks seem to have got exacerbated in the past couple of months, especially with the long-drawn geopolitical crisis and the fresh wave of Covid-19 in China, which have further disrupted the supply-chains,\" said Milind Muchhala, Executive Director, Julius Baer India.  Muchhala, said, this is clearly reflected in the rising inflation prints, margin pressure in March quarter results across sectors due to higher input and freight costs, and the cautious commentaries by various corporates for the near-term.

Analysts also believe this is the right time to pick quality stocks at cheap valuation.  Here's how analysts read the market pulse:  Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst, HDFC Securities, said: a small positive candle was formed on the daily chart with minor upper and lower shadow, indicating high wave-type candle formation.  Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at  LKP Securities , said on the lower end, bulls have protected the crucial support of 16,400, which led to a rally towards 16,600.  The trend is likely to remain positive for the near term as long as 16,400 is held on a sustained basis. On the higher end, resistance is seen at 16,800.”  That said, here’s a look at what some key indicators are suggesting for Tuesday’s action:   Wall Street  opens higher  Wall Street's main indexes opened higher on Monday after a drop last week, with U.S.-listed shares of Chinese technology companies rallying on optimism around easing regulatory crackdowns and relaxing COVID-19 curbs in the world's second-largest economy.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 132.34 points, or 0.40%, at the open to 33,032.04.  The S&P 500 opened higher by 26.18 points, or 0.64%, at 4,134.72, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 187.59 points, or 1.56%, to 12,200.33 at the opening bell.   European stocks rise  European equities rebounded from last week’s declines after China eased Covid-19 curbs, fueling risk-on sentiment.  The Stoxx Europe 600 rose 1% at 1 p.m. in London as a loosening of restrictions in Beijing increased bets that economic activity will pick up. Commodity-tied stocks jumped with oil and metals, while technology shares advanced with peers in Asia and the US.  The FTSE 100 gained 1.3% after UK markets resumed trading following a holiday, even as Boris Johnson faces a leadership vote in his ruling Conservative Party.   Tech View: Bullish candle  After a volatile session, NSE Nifty 50 index closed with minor cuts, but it formed a small bullish candle on the daily charts as bulls managed to defend the crucial support of the 16,400 level.   F&O: Support at 16,000  On the call side, the biggest open interest is at 17,200, followed by 17,000, meaning these are two resistance levels. On the put side, open interest converges at 16,300, followed by 16,500, providing support.   Stocks showing bullish bias Momentum indicator Moving Average Convergence Divergence ( MACD ) showed a bullish trade setup on the counters of Thyrocare Tech, Adani Gas, RBL Bank,  Coromandel International ,  Jubilant Life  and P&G Health.  The MACD is known for signaling trend reversals in traded securities or indices. When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement and vice versa.   Stocks signalling weakness ahead  The MACD showed bearish signs on the counters of  Ramco Cements ,  Gujarat Ambuja ,  Carborundum Universal ,  Gujarat Gas , Tata Investments and  Apollo Tyres . A bearish crossover on the MACD on these counters indicated that they had just begun their downward journey.   Most active stocks in value terms Reliance Industries  (Rs 1421 crore), Infosys (Rs 1006 crore), Aether Industries (Rs 685 crore), ICICI Bank (Rs 680 crore), HDFC (Rs 660 crore), Tata Steel (Rs 613 crore) and JSW Steel (Rs 595 crore) were among the most active stocks on NSE in value terms. Higher activity on a counter in value terms can help identify the counters with the highest trading turnovers in the day.

In the quest to find value from the current fall, we have collated a list of 10 stocks from  Trendlyne  that are in the affordable PE range whose fixed assets value is greater than their market  capitalization , and without a debt-to-equity ratio of less than 1.  Companies use fixed assets to generate income over the long term. It appears in the balance sheet at net book value minus depreciation and any impairment charges.  Top 10 stocks filtered where the value of the fixed asset is greater than the current market capitalization include names like  ONGC ,  IOC ,  Tata Steel ,  HPCL ,  Apollo Tyres ,  GE Shipping , etc. among others.  Can all the stocks be categorized under value bets? Maybe not, suggest experts.  “Most of the companies in the list have businesses that are cyclical in nature. These companies have over the years added assets; however, they have been unable to sweat those assets to achieve any meaningful ROCE (return on capital employed),” Siddharth Oberoi, Founder, Prudent Equity, said.  Return on Capital Employed (RoCE) means the amount of earnings or profit a company generates taking into account not only the shareholders’ equity but also the debt and other sources of funds.  Also Read   “Among the entire list, only Tata Steel and  Jindal Steel  have been able to achieve double-digit ROCE, that too due to rise in steel prices over the last two years. Before that, even their return on capital remained abysmal,” he said.  Agencies  At least 7 out of the 10 stocks have fallen up to 39 per cent so far in 2022. In the traditional sense, a company is considered undervalued in case the market value of the company is lower than the fixed assets.  However, in reality, this is not always true as the net realizable value or the market value might be materially different than the book value.  “You can’t ascertain the correct market value unless the company disposes of some of its assets or gets liquidated. In the case of liquidation, historically in India, fixed assets are sold at a haircut or value less than the market value,” Punit Patni, Equity Research Analyst,  Swastika Investmart Ltd , said.  “In short, this type of data is relevant only for companies having assets that are marketable or market value can be easily ascertained e.g. banks, NBFC’s,” he said.   What are the other parameters to track?  Companies having fixed assets more than the  market cap  does not necessarily entail that these companies are undervalued. Investors should use other metrics to value a company before taking a buy or a sell decision, suggest experts.  “While having more assets is a positive for any company as assets have the ability to generate income, it is also important to look at the company's liabilities,” Rohit Khatri, AVP- Fundamental Research,  Religare  Broking Ltd, said.  “The prudent approach would be to look at the book value of the company which is assets minus the liabilities which will give a true picture of the company's financial position,” he said.  Khatri further added that a prima facie assessment suggests that most of these companies operate in capital intensive business which would require higher fixed assets.  Patni of Swastika Investmart Ltd recommends investors to understand fundamentals, management quality, competitive landscape, cash flows, return ratios like ROCE, ROE, ROIC, etc, and debt & leverage ratios.   What should investors do?  Investors should analyse various parameters highlighted above to make a buy or sell decision. Most stocks could remain under consolidation mode but some of them like Tata Steel,  BPCL , HPCL, and Birla Corp could be a long-term play.  It is important to track how the company is utilizing its assets by using the fixed asset turnover ratio. An expanding ratio entails that the company is able to generate higher revenue with no change in fixed assets, suggest experts.  “The usual checklist of industry growth prospects, company fundamentals, and valuations are important to track before investing. Within the aforementioned stocks, most of these belong to highly cyclical sectors and have witnessed decent correction owing to growth or margin concerns,” Khatri of Religare Broking Ltd said.  “Therefore, while we are constructive on some of the names like Tata Steel, BPCL, HPCL, and Birla Corp, the near-term underperformance cannot be ruled out,” he said.

Both indices are a little shy of entering the bear zone.  According to the market experts, the aggressive rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to curb inflation have induced fear of recession and dented the equities.  The increase in US rates also raises a major possibility that apart from the equity market, other  markets  like debt and bond markets may also see some FIIs outflow anytime soon in India, said  Ravi Singh , Vice President & Head of Research, ShareIndia.  In this momentum,  Nifty  may continue the sell-off and touch the levels of 14,800 in coming trading days,\" he added. \"Investors must wait for entering any fresh positions and watch for the sentiments to turn around.  Geopolitical tensions, global correction, elevated commodity prices, disrupted supply chains, outflow of FIIs, high inflation and a weaker rupee are among the key reasons that have led to the sharp wealth erosion in the markets lately.  According to Singh, both the indices may show some recovery around their first supports. \"However, it would not be sustainable,\" he cautioned.  Nifty50's support levels are 15,100 and then 14,800, whereas 15,600 and 15,800 will act as the resistance levels. On the other hand, 32,200 and 31,700 are the support zones for the Nifty Bank, with resistance at 33,450 and 34.200, Singh said.  Index heavyweights, including metal, IT and financials, have remained weak the most. Most sectoral indices have taken a sharp downward route, hitting their lowest levels in the last year.  The soaring inflation numbers due to Ukraine Russia war led supply disruptions are weighing on the metal prices affecting the operating margins and profit growth, putting the metal counters under pressure, said ShareIndia's Research head.  IT stocks are witnessing selling pressure as the margins have declined on account of supply-side pressures,\" he added. \"The combination, higher inflation, higher rates and FII selling have pushed the banking sector to its worst performance.  However, he is suggesting a few sectors to hunt value at the current juncture. He said that one can look at FMCG, IT and gas sectors with a long-term investment view.  Dabur ,  Hindustan Unilever ,  ITC ,  Tata Consultancy Services ,  HCL Technologies ,  Indraprastha Gas ,  ONGC , Bharat Electronics, IEX,  Apollo Tyres  and  Gail  are at attractive levels to go long.  He also suggested short  Titan Company ,  Info Edge  (Naukri),  Muthoot Finance ,  Bata India  and  ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company  in the current market gloom.  The benchmark indices are not showing any signs of recovery soon and any trend rebound is not sustainable, suggest the market experts. Investors should follow the wait-and-watch strategy in this scenario.  Investors can deploy 40 per cent of their investment at the current levels, whereas the remaining 60 per cent near 14,800 levels. \"Existing investors may wait for lower levels to average their positions,\" Singh from ShareIndia suggested.  Market participants suggest that long-term investors should stick with robust fundamentals and not worry about short-term volatility.  Among the second rung counters, Singh sees a good opportunity for investors to make money. \"Adani Power,  Ashok Leyland , Ambuja Cement, IEX, MCX and BSE are some stocks for good returns.

With capex for Phase II of the AP plant concluding in FY22, an increase in capacity utilisation will generate higher cash flows and further deleverage its balance sheet", "article": "Shares of  Apollo Tyres  have fallen more than 30 per cent from its recent October 2021 highs putting the stock firmly in bear grip.  ICICI Securities  in its recent report maintained a 'Buy' rating on the stock with an unchanged target price of Rs 305, signaling a potential upside of over 70 per cent in the counter, from its previous close of Rs 175.9 on Friday.  The brokerage house said that the company is using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to enhance productivity and debottleneck its capacity to grow without depending on incremental capacity addition.  EU  is currently operating at 85 per cent utilisation levels and is expected to improve production with Hungary plant debottlenecking exercise.  With consecutive two years of positive free cash flow (FCF) in FY21-FY22, despite raw material inflationary pressures, and no major plans for further growth capex, FCF is likely to improve substantially, thus further reducing the financial leverage,\" it added.  Motilal Oswal  also believes that Apollo Tyres is well placed, with a strong competitive positioning as well as ready capacities to benefit from a strong recovery in truck/bus radial tyre) TBR and passenger car radial (PCR) in the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and replacement segment.  Apollo Tyres is geared for the next leg of growth, with sufficient capacity to cater to demand from India and Europe. With capex for Phase II of the AP plant concluding in FY22, an increase in capacity utilisation will generate higher cash flows and further deleverage its balance sheet. As compared to its peers, Apollo Tyres offers the best blend of earnings growth and cheap valuations,\" it said.  It further added that the India business has several levers to support margin, diluting the impact of raw material cost inflation. These include operating leverage, increasing share of the most efficient AP plant (not factored in), and likely benefit from PCR exports to the EU, with PLI benefits (not factored in).  While it expects a 200 basis points decline in FY24 EBITDA margin (to 13.5 per cent) over FY21 levels, due to high raw material cost, operating leverage and balance sheet deleveraging will drive 21 per cent profit after tax (PAT) CAGR.  Ambit, however, has maintained a 'sell' call with a target price of Rs 192 (vs Rs 211 earlier). It believes that the company’s consolidated revenue target of USD 5 billion is aggressive and would require investments in growth capex, given more than 80 per cent capacity utilisation across plants currently. This will likely hit the return on capital employed and FCF generation and push up net debt.  Also, delivering an EBITDA margin of more than 15 per cent would hinge on how input commodities like crude and natural rubber are trending then as 25-30 per cent swings in prices of crude is not unusual and would result in a significant impact on profitability,\" it added.  Kotak also believes that the gross margins of domestic tire companies will continue to remain under pressure given multiple headwinds. It has downgraded Apollo Tyres to 'reduce from 'add', with a revised target price of Rs 175, down from Rs 225 earlier.  The company’s EU operations performance over the past 1-2 years has seen sharp improvement led by cost-cutting initiatives, a richer product mix and optimisation of EU plants by the company. However, we expect profitability to remain under pressure in EU operations owing to a sharp increase in crude prices and elevated energy cost in the EU, which will further put pressure on operating costs,\" it said.

Two-wheelers numbers may be weak on a month-on-month (MoM) basis post-marriage season demand in May, they said. Tractors sales may improve MoM but would be weak YoY due to delayed monsoon, analysts added.   Motilal Oswal  said it prefers companies with higher visibility in terms of demand recovery, a strong competitive positioning, margin drivers, and balance sheet strength.  Maruti Suzuki  and  Ashok Leyland  are its top auto picks. It also likes  Tata Motors  as a play on the global PV cycle. In the ancillary space, it prefers Bharat Forge and  Apollo Tyres .  Nomura India prefers Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) due to strong model cycle tailwinds. It also likes Tata Motors and Ashok Leyland. Rising electrification and content per vehicle will be the key value drivers for suppliers, the brokerage added, as it prefers Sona Comstar,  Minda Industries  and Sansera in the ancillary space.

Choice Broking, meanwhile, has an 'Outperform' rating on Ashok Leyland and an 'Add' rating on a handful of stocks such as M&M, Maruti,  Hero MotoCorp  and  TVS Motor . Channel checks, said Choice Broking, suggests sales momentum for PV, CV, and tractor segments may continue to be healthy YoY despite the industry entering into the off-season cycle i.e. July-August. The brokerage expects two-wheeler sales to be weak due to higher vehicle and fuel costs, cooling-off of marriage-related purchases, and weak sentiment in the lower-income bracket.  Nomura India said healthy demand trends sustained for both medium-heavy commercial vehicles (MHCV) and PV in June, as it expects PV wholesales to benefit from improving chip supplies, with June volumes likely at 3,17,000 units, being the ‘all-time best June’ wholesales. The brokerage expects a further improvement in July. For two-wheelers, retail sales have dropped 8-10 per cent MoM post-marriage season demand in May, Nomura said, as it estimates industry retails in June to be below the June 15 levels.  While easing semiconductor supplies boost PV retail figures, CV demand momentum is sustaining. We prefer 4Ws over 2Ws underpinned by strong demand and a stable competitive environment. We expect the CV cycle to maintain its momentum,\" Motilal said.  Motilal said a delayed monsoon has led to the postponement of demand for tractors. Agricultural demand is subdued currently, and commercial demand remains flat. Inventory in the system is around 30 days, it said. On a year-on-year basis, this brokerage expects tractor volumes to decline 3 per cent for M&M and 2 per cent for Escorts.  On a MoM basis, however, Emkay sees tractor volumes improving MoM, with the growth of 11 per cent for Escorts and 10 per cent for M&M in the domestic market. Growth has been restricted as farmer sentiments have been hit by lower crop realisations in recent months, Emkay noted.

As part of its periodic review, the index saw  Adani Enterprises  enter the benchmark index, replacing  Shree Cement . Apart from Nifty50, rebalances have been announced in  Nifty Next 50 , Nifty 500, Nifty 200 and Nifty 100 as well.   The rejig happened to avoid a void in the index following the merger of two major constituents -  HDFC  and  HDFC Bank , which have received most regulatory approvals.   According to a report by  ICICI Securities , following the reshuffle, FY22 P/E of the index will increase by 0.9 per cent to 24.3x, and FY22 returns on equity will dip marginally by 3 basis points to 14.69 per cent. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.   Historical changes The quarterly recapping of Nifty takes into account the changes in free-float market capitalisation of companies and realigns their weighting. The company's free-float m-cap can change due to corporate activities such as buybacks, promoter stake-sale, or issuance of new shares.  Before the September rejig,  Apollo Hospital  entered the elite pack replacing  Indian Oil  in March this year.   ETMarkets.com   Old Guards  Of the 50 stocks in the Nifty, 13 companies – HDFC Bank,  Reliance Industries  (RIL), HDFC, ITC,  Hindustan Unilever , L&T,  State Bank of India ,  Tata Motors  (TaMo), Dr Reddy’s Labs,  Tata Steel ,  Grasim , Hero and  Hindalco  – have been standing tall and have been a part of Nifty50 since its inception at 1,000 on November 03, 1995, or its launch on April 22, 1996.   Barring Tata Steel, Tata Motors, Grasim and Hindalco, most of these 13 stocks have been among the top wealth creators for over two-and-a-half decades now.   Sectoral Representation  Over the years, the bellwether index has undergone a world of change as the representation of sectors remains in consonance with the changes in the underlying economy.   Back in 1996, the index was dominated by old-economy sectors linked to energy, auto commodities. The IT industry had zero representation. HDFC Bank, one of the largest wealth creators in the last 25 years, was the only representative for private banks in 1996, with 0.4% weight. Textiles (with 4.9%), hotels (with 2.2%), and shipping (with 0.9%), which were part of the 1996 batch, have since lost their seats in Elite club. Metals and consumer stocks have also scaled down after peaking in recent years.   The sectoral representation in 2022 is vastly different from 1996 as a shift from manufacturing to services over the past three decades and the rise of the private sector has changed the dynamics of the economy. Over the years, the Nifty50 has transformed to a more focussed index.   ETMarkets.com   ETMarkets.com  In 1996, SBI, HUL, TaMo, and RIL were the company's Top 5 in the Nifty50 index, but in 2005, when energy stocks were ruling the decade,  ONGC 's weightage shot up to 12.4 per cent, only to drop down to around 0.59 per cent in the next few years.    ETMarkets.com  However, despite changing times, RIL and HDFC Bank have managed to stay at the top of the pecking order for the last two years. The stocks at the top of the chain with higher weights have significant firepower to steer the index.    "},

The brokerage further views FY23-FY25E to be favourable for the company, as strong demand coincides with improving margin and steady capex, it said.  “We expect Apollo Tyres to deliver average FCF of Rs 1500 crore/year in FY23-FY25E vs negative mean FCF of Rs 600 crore during FY17-FY22.

The Dalal Street gains, Rs 50 lakh crore in market value terms, have largely been led by hopes that the domestic economy may stay on a strong footing even as developed economies enter a slow lane.  This hope, along with easing commodity prices and healthy June quarter results, has led to the return of FPIs to Indian bourses, easing investor concerns.   Such has been the breadth of this recovery that nearly half of  BSE500 stocks  have climbed over 20 per cent since June lows, with 374 stocks deliving double-digit returns.   Adani Transmission  has emerged as the biggest BSE500 gainer, rallying 93.94 per cent since June 17. This was the day when the BSE Sensex hit its 52-week low of 50,921.22. Since then, the 30-pack index has rallied 9,107 points or 17.73 per cent to 60,467.24 level on Tuesday.  Tube Investments of India  soared 84.28 per cent to Rs 2,743.10 a piece during this period.

Pankaj Pandey, Head – Research, ICICIdirect said the market has been performing well over the last few quarters, owing to huge liquidity, upward earnings cycle and economic revival owing to fading Covid-19 effect.  However market participants should be wary of the rising inflation and the resulting removal of liquidity from the system. Rising inflation risk and hence the withdrawal of ultra-easy monetary policy by global central banks (mainly Federal Reserve) may trigger a sharp rise in bond yields which can cause risk assets to correct. Hence, one can remain invested with a vigilant eye on the move in yields the world over which can result in sharp 10-15% correction from current levels,\" Pandey said.  Apollo Tyres ,  Can Fin Homes , IDFC, Ceat and ABB India rose 53-56 per cent since June lows. The  India Cements  Adani Power,  Grindwell Norton , Metro Brands, EIH,  MAS Financial Services  and KSB remained a few other stocks that delivered over 50 per cent return in the period mentioned.  The ongoing market rally is primarily driven by the sudden reversal of FII strategy: from relentless sellers to relentless buyers. Retail investor support and fundamental support to the market from a strong economy are aiding the rally.

The Nifty50 closed below 18,000 while the S&P BSE Sensex saw a sharp fall of over 400 points.  Sectorally, buying was seen in power, utilities, auto, and public sector stocks, while selling was seen in IT, metals, realty, and healthcare names. Stocks that were in focus included names like  Mahindra CIE , which rose over 3 per cent,  Adani Enterprises , which advanced nearly 5 per cent, and  Apollo Tyres , which gained over 6 per cent.  Here's what Amol Athawale, Deputy Vice President - Technical Research, Kotak Securities, recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:   Mahindra CIE: Buy After a short-term correction, the stock took support near the 50-Day SMA (Simple Moving Average) or Rs 262 and then reversed. Post correction, it bounced back very sharply.  In the last two days, it rallied over 15 per cent from Rs 262 to Rs 310. On Thursday, after a strong uptrend rally, the stock witnessed some profit booking at higher levels.  The short-term structure of the stock is on the bullish side, but a fresh uptrend wave is possible only after a breakout above Rs 300. A close above Rs 300 could take it higher towards Rs 315-325. On the flip side, a fresh round of selling is possible if the stock succeeds to close below the 20-Day SMA or Rs 279. Below which, it could slip till Rs 265-255.   Adani Enterprises: Buy The stock has rallied over 70 per cent so far in this quarter. On Thursday, the stock rallied 5 per cent and registered a fresh all-time high of Rs 3,767.95.  On daily and weekly charts, the stock has formed a promising uptrend continuation formation and also formed a long bullish candle, which is broadly positive.   The medium-term texture of the stock is positive, but due to the short-term overbought situation, we could see some profit booking at higher levels. Hence, buying on dips and selling on rallies would be the ideal strategy for short-term traders. Rs 3,600 and Rs 3,550 would be the key support zone.  As long as the stock is above the same, the uptrend wave is likely to continue. Above this, it could move up to Rs 3,900-4,000. Traders may prefer to exit from the trading long positions on a close below Rs 3,550.   Apollo Tyres: Buy The stock rallied over 6 per cent on September 15th. On Thursday, it opened with a strong note and quickly surpassed the short-term resistance of 285 with strong volume activity.  Despite weak market conditions, Apollo Tyres held strong momentum throughout the day. In the short-term, the stock has formed a strong price volume uptrend continuation formation.  The pattern structure suggests that the breakout action will continue in the near term if the stock trades above the 285 level. For the trend-following traders, 285 would be the key level to watch out for. We can expect an uptrend continuation wave up to Rs 320-325. On the flip side, the uptrend would be vulnerable on a close below Rs 285.   (Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

Strength in Indian equities is well supported by a strong correlation with developed market indices.", "article": "Technical  analysts  expect the benchmark  Nifty  to touch 17,900 this week. Investors can buy on every correction as 17,300 levels could be a strong support going forward.  HDFC Bank ,  Reliance Industries ,  Infosys ,  Tata Steel , L&T and  ITC  are among the top trading picks of analysts for the week.   DHARMESH SHAH  HEAD, TECHNICAL ICICI SEC   Where is the Nifty headed this week?  We expect Nifty to head towards 17,900 in the truncated week while midcaps could relatively outperform. Use the dips to buy as strong support exist at 17,300. Strength in Indian equities is well supported by a strong correlation with developed  market  indices. Last week, Nasdaq and broader  Russell 2000 indexes  registered a breakout from a falling channel of the past seven months. The percentage of  stocks  in Nifty500 above 200- day EMA has risen to 46% against a reading of 30% two weeks ago and the lowest reading of 14% at June lows. The sequential improvement in breadth using longterm indicators signifies broad-based participation in a rally.    What should investors do?  We advise investors to use dips towards 17,400- 17,500 as an incremental buying opportunity. Sectorally, BFSI, IT, Auto, consumption, capital goods, and metal remain focused, with midcaps outperforming large-cap peers. Our preferred large caps for 5-7% upside are HDFC Bank, Reliance Industries, Infosys,  Tata Motors , and L&T; while in midcaps,  Aditya Birla Fashion ,  V-Guard ,  SAIL ,  KPIT Technologies  and  Apollo Tyres  are expected to gain 8-10%.    PRITESH MEHTA  SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT – RESEARCH, YES SECURITIES   Where is the Nifty headed this week?  Last week, Nifty posted gains for the fourth consecutive week and, in the process, overcame several critical levels (i.e., point of equality and three-digit Gann number of 17,600). Currently, it is hovering around a downward sloping trendline drawn off the peak. Nifty’s breadth is in an overbought zone. Such extreme exuberance in short-term breadth often leads to price-wise or sideways correction, yet sectoral churning and strength in index biggies keep the index afloat. In such a scenario, an up-move could extend towards 17,900-18,000 with a stock-specific rally.    What should investors do?  The market is now clearly momentum driven. When such a market assumes the center stage, focusing on upside targets is not advisable. Till correction happens or telltale signs of exhaustion become visible, traders can gainfully ride the current up-move. Metals have rebounded sharply. The ratio of metals vs Nifty has surpassed the peak of June, likely to result in the continuation of metals’ outperformance. Within the space, a bullish turtle breakout is in play in Tata Steel & SAIL, suggesting a rally of 10%   SUDEEP SHAH  HEAD - TECHNICAL & DERIVATIVES,  SBI  SECURITIES   Where is the Nifty headed this week?  Markets continued the positive momentum with the Index closing in the green for the fourth consecutive week. The Volatility Index, India VIX, also has slipped to 17.4 levels indicating that volatility is gradually subsiding and thus providing a comfort factor to the bulls. Chart patterns suggest that the zone of 17,450-17,500 will be strong support going forward. Till the index sustains above 17,450, we may witness a continuation of this rally up to 18,050-18,100. However, if the index slips below 17,450, weakness could persist up to 17,230- 17,150. Options data suggest a broader trading range of 17,400-18,050 for the week.    What should investors do?  Investors should look to buy the dips till 17,450 levels are not breached on the downside on the Nifty and should accumulate quality stocks. At the same time, traders should focus on stocks and sectors that are relatively outperforming the Nifty. While positive momentum and outperformance may be witnessed in large- and mid-cap stocks from the capital goods, power, banking, as well as hospitality sectors (unlock theme), an attractive risk-reward proposition could be witnessed in stocks from the metal and realty sectors. Our preferred large-cap picks are L&T, ITC,  RIL , Tata Motors and HDFC Bank. In mid-caps, stocks like BoB, Deepak Nitrate and  BEL  could continue to see strong buying interest. "},

Weakness was seen across the sectors as all indices ended the week with big cuts. IT, realty, and media indices tanked 4 per cent each, while the auto index weakened 3 per cent. Financial services, banks and consumer durables were also dented.  A host of stocks were buzzing on Dalal Street, including  Vedanta  which plunged over 7 per cent,  CEAT  which shed 4 per cent after hitting new 52-week highs, and  Apollo Tyres  which lost 6 per cent.   Here's what Santosh Meena, Head of Research,  Swastika Investmart  recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:   Vedanta: Buy Shares of Vedanta plunged 7 per cent to Rs 290.60 after the company's clarification over entering the semiconductor business by its holding company Volcan Investments.  After gaining about 20 per cent in the last five sessions, on the back of positive news flow, the mining major saw a knee-jerk reaction to the company's clarification submitted to the bourses.  After making higher highs and higher lows, the counter has given a compressive move and delivered a massive action after a breakout from 100-SMA at around Rs 280 levels.  On the downside, Rs 275-280 is an important and immediate demand zone. On the upside, Rs 320 is an immediate susceptible area. Above this, we can expect a run-up towards Rs 360 levels in the near term.   Apollo Tyres: Buy The tyre company hit new lifetime highs on Friday, surpassing Rs 300 mark as the company launched a range of tyres for premium motorcycles, other than softening of raw material prices and a fall in crude oil.  The counter is in a classical uptrend and has witnessed a breakout of long consolidation on the weekly chart. The overall structure is very bullish as it trades above all-important moving averages.  One can take a position at any dip around Rs 260 as it created a strong base at 20-DMA for a target of Rs 320.   Ceat: Buy  After zooming 20 per cent on Thursday, the tyre maker hit its new 52-week high of Rs 1,787.75 on Friday. However, the stock saw some profit booking dropped 4 per cent.  The company’s management has laid out the strategic roadmap in its annual investor meet. Increasing market share across key segments and ramping up exports are some of the key focus areas for the management.  The counter is coming out of a long consolidation with strong volume. The overall structure is very bullish as it trades above its all-important moving averages. The structure of the counter looks lucrative on the daily chart, but we are expecting booking profit at a higher level.  One can take a position at 9, 20-SMA around Rs 1400 levels for the target of Rs 2000 while on the downside Rs 1200 is the important support level in the near term.

We expect margin to recover from 2HFY23, with a softening in underlying RM prices.", "article": "After witnessing hyperinflation in its key input cost over the last 15-18 months, the tyre industry is seeing moderation in natural rubber as well as crude prices with a lag in synthetic rubber and carbon black prices.  This augurs well for a margin recovery from 2HFY23.   Since the breakout of geopolitical issues and tightening of interest rates, tyre makers were largely focused on sweating assets and controlling capex.  This is reflected in capacity utilisation of 80-90% across players in 1QFY23. Key input prices had seen an incessant increase over 50% since 1HFY21, with the average RM basket costing around Rs 180/kg, resulting in an over 10pp fall in gross margin.  But now the natural rubber prices appear to have peaked out in mid-June 2022. Spot prices for natural rubber (Thailand spot/RSS4 Kottayam) fell 34%/12.5% from its 1QFY23 average.  Synthetic rubber and carbon black prices are still 6-7% higher over its 1QFY23 average but it’s a reflection of the delayed impact of crude oil price inflation in 1HCY22.  Since underlying crude oil prices have corrected by 22% from its 1QFY23 average, it should reflect with a lag in both synthetic rubber and carbon black prices.  A sharp correction in natural rubber and crude prices to drive a sharp margin recovery from 3QFY23 and EPS upgrades. We expect margin to recover from 2HFY23, with a softening in underlying RM prices.  As per our estimates, for every 10% change in natural rubber/synthetic rubber/ carbon black prices (over its FY22 average), EBITDA margin will change by 160bp/80bp/100bp.  On an FY22 base, we expect blended gross margin to expand by ~190bp in FY24 (+300bp over FY23E). Our gross margin estimate implies a mean reversion to ~36.8% (its 10-year average) by FY25  While demand from OEMs improves across categories, replacement demand has been a mixed bag.  Replacement demand is holding up well for the PCR and 2W segments. However, replacement demand is relatively weak for truck and bus (T&B) and tractors.  Our interactions with the industry participants suggest that T&B demand should see a recovery from 3QFY23 onwards as the noise around inflation tapers off.  After two years of deep pain in a hyper-inflationary environment, we see these headwinds abating, thus driving a margin recovery from 2HFY23 and an earnings upgrade.  We expect a sharp improvement in FCF generation, a reduction in financial gearing, and an improvement in return on capital employed (RoCE). We expect RoCE for mainstream Tyre players is expected to more than double over FY22 to ~11% (v/s an average of sub-9% over the last five years).  Apollo Tyre is our preferred play on tyres as it offers the best blend of earnings growth and cheap valuations:   Apollo Tyres : Buy | LTP Rs 289 | Target Rs 325 | Upside 12%  Apollo Tyre is well placed, with a strong competitive positioning as well as ready capacities to benefit from the strong recovery in truck, bus and radial tyres (TBR) and passenger car radial tyres (PCR) in the OEM and replacement segments.  Driven by strong growth across its Indian and European operations, it is likely to deliver 10% revenue CAGR over FY22-25E. We estimate 8% volume CAGR over FY22-25 and 4% CAGR in price realisations.  As compared to its peers, Apollo Tyre offers the best blend of earnings growth and cheap valuations.   Balkrishna Industries : Buy | LTP Rs 1,918 | Target Rs 2,300| Upside 20%  We expect  BIL ’s outperformance to the specialty tyre industry to continue, driven by expansion of its product portfolio and ramp-up in the Off the Road tyres (OTR) segment, with scope to strengthen its competitive positioning.  We estimate revenue/EBITDA/PAT for BIL to grow at 15%/16%/13% over FY22-25E.   (The author is Head – Retail Research,  Motilal Oswal Financial Services .

While  Maruti Suzuki  reported its second-best monthly sales in the last 42 months at 1,48,380 units,  Tata Motors  attained its highest-ever monthly sales of 47,654 last month, led by record sales of Nexon and Punch.   The domestic passenger vehicle industry reported its best-ever monthly sales performance in September at 3,55,946 units, registering a year-on-year increase of 91%.   \"Retail demand continues to remain strong and easing chip shortages has led to a decline in waiting periods. Wholesales in September doubled on a low base, which was affected due to chip shortages,\"  Motilal Oswal  said in a note.   The brokerage said while sales figures of two-wheelers (2Ws),PVs and CVs were in line, tractors were above estimates. \"The upcoming festival season (Navratri and Diwali) is a crucial period for 2W retails. Festivals such as Ganesh Chaturthi and Onam had an encouraging start. Dealer inventory stands at 50-60 days as per our channel checks,\" it said, adding that it expects the commercial vehicle segment to maintain its momentum.  JM Financial  said the near-term 2W domestic demand is contingent on rural sentiment and festive-related demand.  On the back of strong demand and stable competitive environment, Motilal prefers 4Ws over 2Ws.   Top picks  Within the OEM pack, Motial's top picks are Maruti Suzuki and  Ashok Leyland . Among auto component stocks, it prefers Bharat Forge and  Apollo Tyres . The brokerage also likes Hero Moto as a pure play on the expectations of domestic demand recovery.  Independent market expert Sandip Sabharwal said some two-wheelers like  TVS  are doing well and the stock has also gone up substantially. “Hero MotoCorp continues to underperform. So I think that the stock would languish. Overall, the story is that even if volumes outperform a bit, the margin improvements will be so strong over the next few quarters that that itself should help these stocks do decently,” he said.  The Nifty Auto index that has rallied around 15% so far year-to-date was trading 1% lower on Monday.

Going by momentum indicator Moving Average Convergence Divergence, or MACD, these stocks look poised to come crushing down anytime now.   Among the stocks that witnessed bearish crossovers on Tuesday were several prominent names such as  SBI ,  Tata Steel ,  Jindal Stainless  (Hisar), Welspun Enterprises,  Amtek Auto ,  Andhra Cement , RBL Bank,  KEC International ,  Govind Rubber ,  ITD Cementation  and  Bajaj Finance .   The outlook for the broader  market  has turned sluggish since the Nifty50 scaled a new lifetime peak on Monday as macro-economic fundamentals of the domestic  economy  sent out signs of distress. On Tuesday, the BSE Sensex slipped 21.39 points, or 0.07 per cent, to close at 32,402, while NSE’s Nifty50 index settled 5.55 points, or 0.05 per cent, lower at 10,147.   “The Nifty has to continue to hold above 10,138 to extend its move towards 10,200 and then 10,270 levels, while on the downside, supports are seen at 10,080 and 10,050 levels,” said Chandan  Taparia , Derivatives and Technical Analyst,  Motilal Oswal Financial Services .   Stewart & Mackertich said considering Nifty’s multiple timeframe and overall chart patterns, the Nifty50 should remain stuck in the 10,120-10,180 band ahead of the FOMC decision on Fed funds rate scheduled to be released later on Wednesday.   Many of the counters that witnessed bearish crossovers also saw strong trading volume, which adds further credence to the emerging trend. Other names on the list include  Emami Infrastructure , Dr Lal Pathlabs,  Som Distilleries ,  Oscar Investment  and JSW Holdings.   The MACD is one of the most effective trends-following momentum indicators used to spot a change in the short-term trend of the market.   The MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of prices. It is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages. A nine-day exponential moving average, called the ‘signal’ line, is plotted on top of the MACD to show ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ opportunities. A ‘sell’ signal occurs when the MACD falls below the signal line and vice-versa.      However, the MACD indicator alone may not be sufficient to take an investment or trading call. Traders should make use of other indicators such as Fibonacci series, RSI, candlestick patterns, Bollinger Bands and Stochastic to confirm any emerging trend.   Investors should consult financial experts before buying or selling a stock based on such technical signals.   MACD charts also threw up bullish signals for 68 stocks on BSE, as they witnessed upward crossovers or bullish crossover on Tuesday, indicating the commencement of an upward journey.      In a bearish crossover, the MACD value will always be lower than that of the signal value. For example, in  Hindustan Zinc , the MACD value is 6.53 and the signal line value is 6.62. Tata Steel’s MACD value is 20.35, which is below its signal line value of 20.69.

A trend analysis of the rankings shows that the cut-off revenue — the revenue reported by the 500th company on the list — has grown in tandem with the country’s GDP. For instance, the cut-off revenue at Rs 1,759 crore of the last company (RCI Industries) on the ET 500 list this year is double the Rs 805 crore of the last company ( Heidelberg ) in the 2009 listing.

Among the movers and shakers,  Coal India  entered the top 10 of the latest ET 500 listing. It jumped six places to secure the ninth spot due to higher offtake of coal by thermal power plants, which increased its revenue by 12% year-on-year. Also, after leapfrogging by 20 places last year,  Rajesh Exports  moved two spots up to the fifth position in the latest ET 500. These were two major movers in the top 10.

The  Reserve Bank of India  defines a wilful defaulter as one who had the ability to pay up, but did not, and other factors including diversion of funds.      According to finance ministry data, total outstanding loans by wilful defaulters stood at Rs 92,376 crore at the end of financial year 2016-17, up 20 per cent over the previous year. There are 8,915 cases of wilful defaulter listed by PSU banks as on March 2017. Of this, banks have filed FIR in 1,914 cases with outstanding loans of Rs 32,484 crore.   “This is a very positive move. This will bring credit discipline among borrowers,” said R Marathe, CEO of  Bank of Maharashtra .   Prime Minister Narenda Modi government’s clean-up of the system is gathering momentum as it empowered the RBI earlier this year to direct banks to take defaulters to the National Company Law Tribunal which would work on resolution in a time-bound manner.   Code Tweak to Bring Credit Discipline, say Bankers    “If this amendment had not come in place, it would have diluted the government’s efforts to resolve the issue of bad loans,” said Kalpesh Mehta, partner, Deloitte India. “There is now a real chance that promoters can lose control and are no longer in a position to take creditors for a ride,” Mehta pointed out.   The amendment comes at a time when as many as 400 companies are being referred to Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code for the resolution of the stressed assets. This also includes the 11 large cases that are referred to the bankruptcy court following directions from the Reserve Bank of India.   Resolution professionals working on resolving cases including  Essar Steel , Bhushan Power,  Bhushan Steel ,  Amtek Auto  and  Lanco Infratech .

These associate companies or group firms are estimated to be claiming as high as 59 per cent of total operational creditor amount in some cases, making  Insolvency  professional’s assessment of credit claims a difficult task amid government crackdown on promoters looking to game the system.   Among the 12 large cases referred to the  bankruptcy  court under the  Reserve Bank of India  orders, Essar Steel has received claim from 1,666 operational creditors for Rs 22,917 crore are firms with ‘Essar’ tag, said those people who did not want to be identified.   These companies are like Essar Academy and Essar Steel Trading - indicting that these may be associated companies, although this could not be independently verified. These 20 creditors have a claims of Rs 6121.7 crore which is 26 per cent of the total operational creditors, said those people. The highest claim is from Essar Steel Jharkhand at Rs 2,498 crore followed by Essar Projects (India) Ltd at Rs 1,140 crore, Essar Power at Rs 912 crore and Essar Bulk Terminal at Rs 704 crore.   Lanco Infratech has received claims from operational creditors of Rs 8,880 crore and among these are six companies with Lanco name as prefix. They have claimed as much as Rs 5,252 crore which is 59 per cent of the total claims made by operational creditors.   Of this, the highest claim is from Lanco International at Rs 2,347 crore, followed by Lanco Vidarbha at Rs 1,111 crore and Lanco Amerkantak at Rs 908 crore. Lanco Anpara and Lanco Babandh Power have claimed Rs 279 crore each.   While it is normal for companies to deal with associates for services and many of them may be for better efficiencies, these claims have posed a challenge to Insolvency Professionals who are under stress now to keep an eagle eye on promoters.   The government recently amended the  Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code  to ensure promoters don’t make a backdoor entry and the IBBI has ordered IPs to be vigilant about the activities of potential investors.   Similarly,  Amtek Auto  has received Rs 223 crore claims from operational creditors of which Indraprasta Engine Parts, which is owned by Arvind Dham, promoter of Amtek, has made a claim of Rs 83.6 crore. This amounts to 37 per cent of the total claims of operational creditors. In other cases, Binani Cement Factory Dubai has made a claim of Rs 32.17 crore for Binani Cement.   The outstanding loans of the banking industry to these 12 companies was originally estimated at Rs 2.25 lakh crore, but if the operational creditors’ claims is factored it could rise to Rs 3.25 lakh crore, shows data compiled by ET.   The operational creditors are not in a position to influence the resolution plan since they are not part of committee of creditors. Also, if the company goes for liquidation, they rank sixth in receiving payments of what is remaining after making payment to workman dues, employee dues, secured creditor, unsecured creditor and debt of central and state government.

The company faces claims in the range of Rs 8,500 crore from financial and operational creditors.   Amtek Auto :  The UK-based metals group Liberty House and Deccan Value Investors, a US-registered hedge fund have emerged as top contenders for auto component maker Amtek Auto which is in bankruptcy courts awaiting resolution, said two senior officials familiar.   Tata Motors:  HSBC  has maintained ‘buy’ rating on Tata Motors with a target price of Rs 500. Tata Motors’ domestic/traditional India business is on the path of recovery and has the potential to make a difference to the stock price in the coming years, said HSBC.    Pidilite Industries :    CLSA has retained ‘sell’ rating on Pidilite Industries with a target price of Rs 870. Pidilite remains one of the best franchises in the building materials space but we believe valuations at 40 times FY20 earnings basis leave little room for upside, particularly given a 13 per cent earnings CAGR over FY18-FY20 period.    Telecom stocks:  The telecom regulator may reduce international termination rate (ITR) — a charge paid by international operators to local networks that receive calls — by almost half from the current 53 paise a minute, a move that would deal a body blow to India’s top telcos Bharti Airtel, Vodafone India and Idea Cellular which receive bulk of international calls. “ITR could be 25-30 paise a minute,” said a person aware of developments, asking not to be named. “It may be announced very soon.   Varun Beverages:  has concluded the acquisition of PepsiCo India's previously franchised rights for the state of Chhattisgarh.  Shree Cement:  Board of Shree Cement at its meeting has approved the acquisition of majority equity stake in Union Cement Company, UAE. The Company has also signed the Definitive Agreement in this regard with the sellers.   Indiabulls Real Estate:  The company through its wholly-owned subsidiary Yashita Buildcon has entered into a binding and definitive agreement to acquire a prime and newly constructed commercial building, having leasable area of approx 2.5 lac sq ft in Gurugram.   Texmaco Rail & Engineering:  The company has incorporated a subsidiary namely, Texmaco Defence Systems.      "},

No resolution has yet been found in any of these cases.  Initially, Liberty House and Deccan Value Investors submitted bids for Amtek Auto without providing the bid bond guarantee. The bid bond is a must for lenders to consider debt resolution plans. It is a letter of comfort from a bank or a bank guarantee that indicates that the bidder has either the cash balance to complete the transaction or the banks would step in.  Both applicants were given one week to furnish the bid bond. While Liberty House submitted the bond in the first week of January, Deccan Value Investors furnished the guarantee a week later. "},

CHANDAN  TAPARIA   ANALYST-DERIVATIVES,  MOTILAL OSWAL FINANCIAL SERVICES    Where is the Nifty headed this week?  The Nifty continued its formation of lower highs on the weekly scale and formed a hammer candle with a long lower shadow. It formed a bullish engulfing candle on a daily scale with a negation of lower highs of the last seven trading sessions, which indicates that supports are visible. However, the major trend is under pressure, with weakness persisting in higher zones. Mechanical indicators are still on a bearish trend, but daily momentum is getting some stability. This indicates that support-based buying could be seen on the decline even after having multiple barriers at higher zones. October has a more positive track record, but shorts with call writing at higher strike indicate the continuation of a bumpy ride ahead. Now, the Nifty has to hold above 17,017 zones for an up move towards 17,250 and 17,442 zones, whereas supports are placed at 16,888 and 16,750 zones.    What should  investors  do?  Investors can use this move to add good quality stocks from FCMG, consumption, auto, and selective banking stocks. At the same time, traders are suggested to play with options spread rather than taking more leveraged positions. One can go with Bull Call Spread by buying 17,100 Call and selling 17,300 Call to play the bounce towards 17,300 zones. Stock-specific positive stances are seen in  Aditya Birla Fashion , India Cement, Ambuja, Trent, and  Apollo Tyres .   AJIT MISHRA  VP-RESEARCH,  RELIGARE  BROKING   Where is the Nifty headed this week?  Nifty has been witnessing correction for the last three weeks in line with global indices. It has retraced from the previous swing high of 18,096 levels and is currently trading at 17,094 levels. Indications favour a rebound above the 17,200 zones. However, the upside seems to be capped in the 17,400-17,600 zone. On the downside, the 16,800-16,650 zone would support if profit booking resumes. Meanwhile, cues from the global markets, especially the US, which is not seeing any respite, would continue to trigger volatility.    What should investors do?  Investors shouldn’t read much into the recent decline and focus on accumulating quality stocks from banking, auto, FMCG, and selectively in IT and pharma. We like ICICI Bank, SBI, Eicher Motors, Maruti, Britannia, Hindustan Unilever, and  Sun Pharma  from these sectors. On the other hand, we recommend maintaining caution while selecting stocks from the mid-cap and small-cap baskets, as recovery could be restricted only to the fundamentally good counters.   NAGARAJ SHETTI  TECHNICAL ANALYST, HDFC SECURITIES   Where is the Nifty headed this week?  The short-term trend of the Nifty has turned positive with a sharp up move seen last Friday. The bullish engulfing pattern of the daily chart and bullish hammer of the weekly chart indicates a formation of a strong bottom reversal around 16,750-16,800 levels. A sustainable move above 17,200- 17,300 is likely to open the next upside of 18,100 levels in the next few weeks. Any weakness down to 16,800 could be a buy-on-dips opportunity.    What should investors do?  One may look to create long positions during the current market consolidation. Create aggressive longs on the move above 17,300. Sectorally, banking, pharma, IT, and realty are expected to outperform in the near term. Stocks with a positive bias include  Axis Bank ,  IndusInd Bank , Sun Pharma, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories,  Coforge , TCS, DLF, and  Oberoi Realty .  "},

As the NDA government completes three years in office, about one-fourth of all BSE-listed  stocks  are beaming with gains ranging from at least 100 per cent to as high as 16,000 per cent!   And with the benchmark equity indices,  Sensex  and Nifty50, surpassing previous record levels of 30,000 and 9,400, respectively, this period has proved to be a sort of golden age for the domestic equity market despite the occasional blips and the scaremongering that it has gone through in the interim.   Since May 16, 2014, when the results of the general election were announced, over 1,250 stocks have surged between 100 per cent and 16,000 per cent with themes related to consumer spending, rural consumption, textiles and housing finance ruling the roost.   These sectors also produced many multibaggers during this period.   “The domestic equity market has been on an upward trajectory supported by an improvement in the fundamentals of the  economy .  Earnings  growth has improved from the levels seen three to four quarters ago. Fundamentals are expected to improve on the back of improving macroeconomic indicators with benefits of reforms percolating to the ground level and a conducive inflation/interest rate environment. We think the market would continue to trend upwards over the long term,” said Prasanth Prabhakaran, Senior President and CEO, YES Securities.   Between May 16, 2014 to May 11, 2017, the auto and auto ancillaries sectors produced over 70 multibaggers, with  Minda Industries  surging the most at 1,168 per cent, followed by Force Motors (up 1,127 per cent) and  Jay Bharat Maruti  (up 1,109 per cent).   Among others, shares of  Subros , Rane Braking,  JBM Auto  and  Sharda Motor  advanced 835 per cent, 673 per cent, 647 per cent and 560 per cent, respectively.   Despite talks of a slowdown in the real estate sector, many cement, housing finance and construction players delivered robust returns to investors ever since the Modi government came to power.   Over 30 companies from the cement space surged up to 1,260 per cent in last three years. The share prices of smallcap cement players such as Shri Keshav soared 1,262 per cent, followed by  Shiva Cement  (up 877 per cent).   Among others, Dalmia Bharat,  NCL Industries ,  Deccan Cements  and  OCL India  have climbed 874 per cent, 827 per cent, 624 per cent and 545 per cent, respectively.   Cement majors like  Mangalam Cement , Orient Cement,  Birla Corporation ,  Shree Cement  and JK Cement gained 150 per cent, 149 per cent, 147 per cent, 223 per cent and 319 per cent, respectively, in last three years.   In the construction space, shares of Vipul,  ITD Cementation  and  Gayatri Projects  surged over 1,000 per cent during this period. Construction majors such as  NBCC  (up 464 per cent), Emami Infra (up 404 per cent), J Kumar Infra (up 180 per cent),  ARSS  Infra (up 139 per cent) and  Godrej Properties  (up 135 per cent) have been among the top gainers.   Fertiliser players such as GNFC, National Fertilizer, Zuari Agro Chem, Chambal Fert, FACT, RCF, Zuari Global and  Aries Agro  have soared between 170 per cent and 240 per cent in last three years.   Rural-focused stocks have been hogging limelight these days, after the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) said  monsoon  rainfall will be higher than the previous forecast, which would mean more disposable income in the hands of people in rural areas. Market experts believe the next multibaggers could come from the rural-focused sectors.   As many as 138 textile-related players advanced nearly 1,900 per cent during this period. Shares of  Indo Count ,  Faze Three ,  Shiva Texyarn  and  KPR Mill  advanced between 1,000 per cent and 1,900 per cent. Other textile majors such as  Nitin Spinners ,  Rainbow Denim  and  Arrow Textiles  have gained 719 per cent, 626 per cent and 590 per cent, respectively, in last three years.   NBFC and select private sector banks also impressed investors with their performance. Shares of  Can Fin Homes  and Florence Invetech soared 1,153 per cent and 1,072 per cent, respectively. Motilal Owal Financial Services,  Bajaj Finance ,  Bajaj Finserv ,  Prime Securities  and Capital First soared over 300 per cent during the period.   Private lenders DCB Bank,  YES Bank ,  City Union Bank ,  Lakshmi Vilas Bank ,  Federal Bank ,  Kotak Mahindra Bank  and  IndusInd Bank  doubled investor wealth in last three years.   In a chat with ETNow, Milan Sharma of Rivergate Capital said: “If someone is patient for three to five years, Lakshmi Vilas Bank can be a multibagger kind of idea. It can easily double from these levels.”   Kunj Bansal, ED & CIO,  Centrum  Wealth Management, said: “At the current level of the market, we have to prefer a stock that gives comfort in terms of valuation. City Union Bank is a stock that has a lot of potential to become a multibagger in the coming years. The return on assets has been rising gradually from 1 per cent to 1.5-1.6 per cent in FY18 and FY19.”   Among the top gainers on BSE, Ducon Infratechnologies surged the most at 16,793 per cent, followed by  Uniply Industries  (up 6,495 per cent),  Medicamen Biotec  (up 6,033 per cent),  Fiberweb  (up 5,631 per cent),  Mangalam Drugs  (up 3,450 per cent) and  Stylam Industries  (up 3,084 per cent).   For identifying multibaggers in the coming years, one should keep an eye on government-focused sectors as well as rural theme, says Prabhakaran of YES Securities. “Two major themes should play out in the days to come; one is the rural theme as the measures announced by the government so far should help boost agricultural productivity and consequently rural income. Therefore, stocks focused on agri and/or rural consumption could be the next multibaggers. The second theme we are positive on is the  affordable housing  segment. The government’s focus on affordable housing will not just boost real estate companies in this segment but also to the over 70 industries such as housing finance and ceramic tiles that are directly or indirectly dependent on affordable housing.”   Foreign portfolio investors have poured over Rs 1.40 lakh crore in domestic equity markets since May 2014, as per data available with depository NSDL.   Pankaj Pandey, Head of Research, ICICIdirect, said: “Enabling fundamental factors such as stabilised commodity base, upbeat consumption and most importantly, a lower base and potential for earnings growth from here on could lead to strong double-digit growth recovery in FY18E and keep market sentiments buoyant.” "},

Among them,  stocks  of 540 companies have delivered positive returns to investors and risen up to 950 per cent during this period.   With 950 per cent stock return since June 2015, Jayant Agro-Organics tops the list. The stock has surged from Rs 95 on June 22, 2015 to Rs 995.30 as of June 22, 2017. Net profit of the company surged from Rs 0.67 crore for the quarter ended December 2014 to Rs 15.59 crore for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.   Jayant Agro-Organics is an oleochemicals company, focused on the castor-based specialty chemicals business.   This March rating agency  Crisil  upgraded Jayant Agro-Organics from Crisil BBB+ to Crisil A-, reflecting better-than-expected improvement in its debt-to-Ebitda and interest coverage metrics, which it is expected to sustain over the medium term.    Star Paper Mills  is the second-best player on the list and the stock has delivered 873 per cent return during this period, surging from Rs 21 to Rs 210 between June 2015 and June 2017. The company is engaged in paper manufacturing.   It also clocked bottom line growth in 10 straight quarters. Net profit rose from Rs 2.22 crore in the December quarter of 2014 to Rs 18.33 crore in March quarter of FY17.

Shares of Escorts have been in the limelight these days amid an improvement in outlook for the country’s agriculture sector due to a normal  monsoon  forecast for 2017, and a good  Rabi  harvest.   Besides these, share prices of  Minda Industries ,  Bodal Chemicals ,  Ruchira Papers ,  Gufic  BioScience,  Phillips Carbon ,  Uniply Industries , SORIL Infra, Cineline India, Indiabulls Venture,  Lumax Industries  and  Can Fin Homes  have soared between 350 per cent and 490 per cent in last two years.    Bhansali Engineering ,  V-Guard Industries ,  Ceat ,  Heritage Foods  and  Swaraj Engines  also made it to the list of 115 stocks that have delivered returns between 100 per cent and 200 per cent in last two years.   Bhansali Engineering is among the top wealth creation ideas of Vikas Sethi, MD of Sethi  Finmart . In an interview with ETNow, he said, “There is a lot of steam left in Bhansali Engineering. This company is a leading manufacturer of ABS, which finds application in industries like automobiles, home appliances and telecom. They have a technical collaboration with a world leader like Nipponm Japan. The company has performed extremely well in terms of financial results. It net profits had actually gone up 20 times from Rs 75 lakh to around Rs 15 crore, and I feel with the increase in ABS prices because of production cuts in China, this company is going to do pretty well in the future. I like the stock at the current level of Rs 55 and have a target of Rs 85 in a year.”   Brokerage firm KR Choksey Shares and Securities has an ‘accumulate’ rating on Heritage Foods with a target price of Rs 1,205.   “With footprints across 10 states in India, Heritage Foods is a strong player in south India. The company plans is to remain focused on its core dairy business and invest in it. Most of its revenues come from the liquid milk business and it has plans to expand into value-added products, which will help improve revenue and margins,” KR Choksey said a research report.   Nearly 100 companies on the list gave negative returns to investors despite registering profits in every quarter since December 2014. Analysts attributed the slump to sector-specific issues.   The list includes state-run behemoth  Coal India , IT major  Tech Mahindra ,  Indoco Remedies ,  Eros International Media , Just Dial and  JSW Energy , among others.   Overall, Ebitda for the Nifty50 companies grew 10.4 per cent YoY in Q4FY17, driven primarily by commodity companies.   Brokerage ICICI Securities said the January-March quarter was the second straight quarter where  commodities  boosted operating earnings of the Nifty50. But with global commodity prices stagnating, the favourable base effect will disappear from Q1FY18. PAT growth for the Nifty50 in Q4FY17 was not a true representative of the underlying growth in corporate India, as there is significant volatility in the constituents. The Nifty50 PAT growth for Q4FY17 stood at 5.9 per cent and 2.6 per cent, if one were to exclude commodities and financials. "},

Stocks that witnessed bullish crossovers included L&T Finance Holdings,  FirstSource Solution , Central Bank, HDFC,  Jain Irrigation ,  Steel Authority of India , IDFC Bank,  CESC , Indiabulls Venture and HEG. (see table).   Some of these counters have also been witnessing strong volumes of late, adding further credibility to the emerging trend.   Among others,  Allahabad Bank , Union Bank, Ujjivan Financial,  Andhra Bank ,  Canara Bank ,  TVS Motor  and  Tata Chemicals  witnessed bullish crossovers on Monday.      Meanwhile, some 12 stocks witnessed bearish crossovers on NSE, signalling a bear grip on these counters. The list had names like  Graphite India ,  Thyrocare  Technologies,  Britannia Industries ,  Kalpataru Power ,  Precision Wires ,  SKF India ,  Shiva Texyarn ,  Gujarat Apollo  and Kirloskar Industries. (See table: MACD crossed below signal line)      MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows a relationship between two moving averages. It is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages.   A nine-day exponential moving average, called the ‘signal’ line, is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ opportunities. A ‘buy’ signal occurs when the MACD rises above its signal line and vice-versa.   However, the MACD indicator alone may not be sufficient to help take an investment call. Traders should look at other indicators such as Fibonacci Series, RSI, candlestick patterns,  Bollinger Bands  and Stochastic to confirm any such trend.   Investors should consult their financial advisers before buying or selling a stock based on such technical indicators.   The domestic equity market came out a downturn to log gains for four successive sessions. The 30-share BSE  Sensex  gained 154.76 points, or 0.49 per cent, to close at 31,750 on Monday, while NSE’s  Nifty  index settled 55.75 points, or 0.57 per cent, higher at 9,912.   On the further movement of the 50-share index, Chandan  Taparia , Derivatives & Technical Analyst,  Motilal Oswal , said: “The Nifty50 has to cross and hold above immediate hurdle in the 9,928-9,950 zone to witness a bounce towards 10,020 and 10,050 levels, while holding below the 9,880 level could drag it towards 9,820 and then 9,775.”   Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives, Angel Broking, said: “Interest in the traders’ community has shifted back to the individual stocks. We saw decent stock-specific moves during Monday’s session despite the index oscillating in a very narrow range. We expect the index to consolidate for a while; but within this, we are likely to see selling pressure at higher levels. For the coming session, the 9,930-9,948 range would be a key resistance zone; whereas the 9,880 and 9,850 levers are likely to act as intraday supports for the index.”   Understanding MACD       A close look at the chart of Jain Irrigation shows whenever the MACD line has crossed above the signal line, the stock has always shown an upward momentum. Shares of Jain Irrigation closed 3.20 per cent higher at Rs 98.40 on August 28. "},

No?   It could have been any of these three –  Goldstone Infratech ,  Dwarikesh Sugar  and Goa Carbon;  stocks  that have soared over 1,000 per cent between October 2015 and this October. Either of them could have grown an investment of Rs 1 lakh into Rs 10 lakh between October 2015 and now.   If one-in-three is too tough a call, you could add these three to the list – Himadri Speciality Chemical, HEG and Indiabulls Ventures, whose  shares  climbed 951 per cent, 946 per cent and 943 per cent, respectively, during this period.   Lower the bar a bit, and the list becomes even longer, with names like SORIL Holdings,  Maan Aluminium ,  Jindal Worldwide ,  Thirumalai Chemicals ,  Uttam Sugar Mills , Mawana Sugar,  Beardsell  and Antartica, whose stocks advanced between 800 per cent and 900 per cent in last two years.   The bulls had a good run in the domestic equity  market  over the past two years, despite disruptive events such as  demonetisation  and  GST , which temporarily dented investor sentiment.   Despite these hiccups, the benchmark  Sensex  climbed nearly 25 per cent to 33,213 on October 31, 2017 from 26,656 on October 30, 2015. At present, both Nifty and Sensex are trading at their lifetime high levels.      Stocks that made it to the list of top gainers are of businesses that are growing fast and those which have managed to pare debt.   Sugar firm  Dwarikesh Sugar Industries  is a good example. A star performer this year, this company reported over 88 per cent year-on-year profit growth at Rs 59.27 crore in June quarter (September quarter numbers still awaited), which helped it pare debt from Rs 300 crore at the end of March, 2016 to Rs 76 crore.   It plans to become debt-free soon.   The company expects sales to rise in excess of 15 per cent during the 2017-18 crop year, as production is likely to jump to a record high in  Uttar Pradesh .   Among other gainers that have soared in excess of 700 per cent are  Manaksia  Industries,  Gujarat Narmada Valley  Fertilizers and Chemicals (GNFC),  V2 Retail  and  Tata Metaliks .   Auto ancillary player  Minda Industries  has also managed to get a place among the top gainers of last two years, rising 688 per cent to Rs 820 as of October 31, 2017 from Rs 104 on October 30, 2015.   Stocks like  Phillips Carbon ,  Maithan Alloys ,  Jayant Agro , Future Market Networks, Rain Industries, Sanwaria Consumer and Venky’s  India  have risen over 600 per cent in this period.   Sectors like auto, auto ancillary as well as proxy plays on the agricultural sector such as farm mechanisation equipment and cropcare sectors can throw up big gainers over the next three years, says Nitasha Shankar, Senior Vice President and Head of Research, YES Securities.   Shankar says other interesting themes include housing (indirect plays like building material), as well as consumer durables and retail.  These are interesting segments given the low penetration levels and the higher growth expected due to changing consumption patterns, she said.   A couple of midcap and smallcap stocks have also managed to soar over 500 per cent in last two years. They include  Graphite India , Vardhman Special Steels,  Shiva Texyarn , Manaksia Steels,  Allsec Technologies ,  Star Paper Mills , IG Petrochemicals, Ramky Infra, Cineline India and  Bhansali Engineering .   The buoyant performance of HEG and Graphite India has been driven by a significant change in outlook for the global graphite electrode segment over the past few months, which has brightened the prospects of the sector.   Vinod Nair, Head of Research at  Geojit  Financial Services, says the infrastructure, defence and chemical sectors are likely to throw up big gainers.   In recent times, the chemicals sector witnessed significant re-rating led by softer commodity prices and strong earnings growth. “This trend should continue as domestic speciality chemical manufacturers are still in investment mode to create new products through good R&D with an eye on substituting imports and capturing a share of  global markets .   Higher sourcing from global chemicals manufacturers by domestic manufacturers due to higher regulatory compliance requirement in China and the  Make in India  campaign are is going to support this trend, said Nair.

He has a passion for spotting quality stocks, some of which have delivered him mindboggling returns.  He claims he was an early investor in drug major  Sun Pharma . Though he managed to invest a very small amount in the stock, it delivered 50-bagger return over 15 years. Aveek sold the stock in 2016.  He claims to have earned over 700 per cent return from IFB Industries, 900 per cent from V Guard, 433 per cent from Ajanta Pharma and over 200 per cent from  Zydus Wellness  and  Kitex Garments  over the past few years.  He currently holds Dilip Buildcon, JBM Auto, Cords Cable,  Asian Granito ,  Shiva Texyarn ,  Zen Technologies , Centrum Capital and Edelweiss.  ETMarkets could not independently verify his holdings back then and now, as none of his stakes were above 1 per cent, the threshold beyond which companies name their investors in shareholding reports.  However, Aveek did produce an audited certificate for 2 years, reflection the returns on his portfolio.  At 50, this Bengali with more penchant for stocks than fish, says he is currently looking for ‘gems’ in capital goods, infrastructure, building materials, real estate and niche IT product or services sectors.  The skill to spot a quality stock can be developed over the years, if one has the passion, but it’s not very easy, says he.  One should try to develop his own line of thinking and invest in a way that matches his profile and personality.  “It would disastrous to copy someone blindly, as someone else’s motivation to hold an investment may be 10 years and yours could be just two. Jumping on to an investment just because some famous Mr A, B or C has invested in it may be counterproductive, unless you know how much percentage of his overall portfolio is invested there or what are his expectations out of it,” Aveek said.  “Investment lessons can be learnt only in the ‘school of hard knocks!’ Unless you invest your own money, and that too serious money, based on your capacity, you would never know if you are fit to manage it on our own,” says he.  Aveek generally aims for 30 per cent CAGR (compounded annual growth rate) kind of return on his portfolio, rather than looking for stock-specific success.  A 30 per cent CAGR return can double you money in less than three years.  Aveek says his investment strategy is always bottom-up and starts from a sectoral outlook, where he feels there is a tailwind. “I seldom try to seek valuation comfort in an out-of-favour sector. Once we identify the sector, we look at almost all major players in that sector, try to identify the similarity or dissimilarly among different players, look at their competitive strengths, past history, management quality, financial and liquidity profiles and them try to figure out if they can do disproportionately better than the overall sector at least in the medium term. Rest is valuation,” he told to ETMarkets.com.  He does not invest in very small or a new company if it has a short history.  Aveek is a hard-working investor, who is never tired of studying companies to invest in. His approach is unique, in the sense that he is not afraid of buying poor quality companies provided he can get the valuation right, says Abhishek Basumallick, a value investor himself.  Basumallick says Aveek has been successful by going off the beaten track. “I find it comforting to bounce off ideas with him, because his style is so different from mine, that I always get a different perspective,” he said.  Aveek doesn’t prefer to call himself a value investor. “I don’t really know what is the practical definition of a value investor. I think everyone seeks some value out of their investments, even though everyone strives in a different way.”  Aveek runs a Sebi-registered investment advisory firm, called aveksatequity.com.  “My first and foremost responsibility is to protect capital and steadily grow what is entrusted upon us,” he said.  He said to be a successful investor one needs to have basic grasp of accounts and finance, as the language of communication in business is financial numbers. It’s the bare minimum requirement to understand the numbers given out by the company. This is the first step, says he.  Beyond that one has to have a good understating of the business ecosystem of a company, industry, economy and global competition.   Aveek says one should have the ability to connect multiple seen, unseen and probable dots in his mind in order to be able to have a clear hypothesis about why one is investing in a stock and why it is better than other options available.  “It is better to read as eclectically as possible. It helps in many direct and indirect ways to connect many dots and identify many patterns. The skill can be developed over the years if one has the passion. It’s not very easy,” he says.  Before investing one needs to ensure if he is comfortable with volatility and uncertainty involved in investing. “Unless one is clear about the path s/he is charting to reach the desired destination, the journey itself becomes so bothersome that s/he will be forced to leave it halfway,” said Mitra.  One’s investment should actually match one’s own psychology. Otherwise, one is bound to make mistakes in a volatile market, fall prey to conflicting market signals and to the tremendous amount of noise generated by media every day, he warns.  Aveek entered the stock market at 29. He says he was late because he didn’t have the money to invest and the courage to manage it himself.  In his early investing days, he invested based on the recommendations of a broker friend, and in the process he ended up with half his investment in six months! That was his only savings then.  “I primarily tried to understand, started reading very seriously and the passion grew over time as I got deeper into it. I learned it initially out of desperation, which transformed into a passion with the passage of time as I tasted success and gathered confidence,” he recalls.  He became a full-time investor in 2013. Prior to that, he was holding senior positions in various companies in India and abroad. Till then, his investment was spread across broader themes and directional trends, based on numbers presented in quarterly results and annual reports.   Since 2013, he became more oriented towards micro details of the company. “I can now invest in not so known companies as I have more time and resources to research about them. I can even do field research, collect primary data, talk to people, meet managements at different investors’ meets. But the overall thinking process remains more or less similar, though always evolving,” he says.  Aveek said most of his failures came from selling early and not being able to hold a stock longer.   “It is a psychological weakness which I am constantly trying to overcome. I am getting better at it, as I realise time correction, rather than price correction, happens most cases in our market. If the quality of a business and the pedigree of the management is good, hold it. Stocks like Tata Steel, Kaveri Seed, TD Power Systems gave me lemons. I lost more than 25 per cent for selling my positions quickly,” says he.   The single biggest loss he bore was in Escorts, which he has bought at about Rs 220 and sold for Rs 90 sometime between 2010 and 2013.  “If a stock goes down 20 per cent, then it has to come up by 25 per cent to recover my capital, but if it goes down by 50 per cent, then it needs to be up 100 per cent to regain my capital,” says Aveek.  “Capital protection and locking gains is of paramount importance to me, I am quite uncomfortable if my stock goes down more than 25 per cent from my buy price. I am very particular about the price I pay as it’s the only variable which is in my control. Rest of the things are uncontrollable variables, depending on how much I know or I pretend to know,” he says.  His wisdom: Being overconfident is one of the gravest errors. It’s better to be humble to remain liquid and remain solvent to play the game for a long time.  Aveek is a voracious reader. He reads books from across disciplines be it psychology, economics, science, politics, history, biographies, spirituality, evolution, ethics, law and at times investment books referred to him by friends.  “After a while, incremental learning from reading investment books is pretty limited. I also read annual reports of companies on a daily basis, besides research reports of various research houses. I also watch videos of more successful investors,” he says.   Aveek generally does not follow any specific investor, but keeps track of investments that stalwarts make and try to figure out why someone finds a company interesting.  “I got many good investment ideas following investments of known investors. But I invest based on my own convictions, though ideas may have originated from someone else’s purchase,” he says. "},

Amtek Auto had received two binding bids –– from Liberty House and Deccan Value –– in the initial round.  Originally, the binding bids from Deccan Value and Liberty House were below liquidation value, which was rejected by the lenders. Banks, led by State Bank of India and Corporation Bank, had asked both bidders to improve the offer by February 9, failing which they would have considered liquidation of the company.  The liquidation value of Amtek Auto is pegged at 33 per cent of the outstanding loan. The offers made by both companies was 92 per cent of the liquidation amount.  “We understand that the Deccan Value offer is almost on par with the liquidation value,” said one person quoted above. “Deccan Value has offered Rs 4,041 crore. As per the proposal, Rs 2,850 crore will be paid upfront and balance in installments over three to five years.” Banks will now negotiate with the H1 bidder, which is Deccan Value in this case, over the next few days, said people familiar with the development.  Resolution professional Dinkar Venkatasubramanian did not respond to an email sent by ET.  Initially, both bidders did not furnish bid bond guarantee for which banks extended the deadline by a week. A resolution plan for a bankruptcy company would not be considered by lenders if the applicant does not provide bid bond guarantee, which is a letter of comfort from a bank or a bank guarantee that indicates that the bidder has either the cash balance to complete the transaction or the banks would step in.

Castex Technologies is facing Rs 7,391-crore claim from financial creditors and Rs 53 crore from operational creditors. Earlier this week, Sundaresh Bhat, the resolution professional of  ABG Shipyard , had declared that a bid from Liberty House was ineligible under Section 29(A) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Court, implying that they have been classified as defaulter by some Indian lenders.  Close to 98 per cent of the lenders have voted in favour of Liberty House for Amtex Auto a month ago. “The RP, Dinkar Venkatasubramanian, will therefore have to decide on the eligibility of Liberty House before arriving at the highest bidder,” said a bank official. Venkatasubramanian is the RP for Amtek Auto. SBI has the highest exposure of Rs 1,321 crore in Castex, implying 17 per cent share of the loan, and will be very critical in deciding the fate of the company. Castex Technologies, a casting component manufacturer for the automotive sector, was admitted for corporate insolvency resolution on December 20, 2017. Amtek Auto and three of its subsidiaries -- Castex Tehnologies, Metalyst Forgings and ARGL -- are facing insolvency proceedings, and they have combined overdues in the range of Rs 23,000 crore.  Amtek Auto is among the first list of 12 companies that the  Reserve Bank of India  had directed banks in June last year to refer to the National Company Law Tribunal. "},

Following is a status update on eight of those borrowers, which are inching towards a resolution.   Essar Steel  Total Debt: Rs 49,000 crore  Date of referral to NCLT: June 2017  Where it stands now: NCLT ordered committee of creditors (CoC) to consider bids by Numetal and Mittal before allowing others to bid. What is the issue: If creditors decline bids by Numetal and Mittal, mining giant  Vedanta  could be in the fray.   Amtek Auto  Total Debt: Rs 12,722 crore  Date of referral to NCLT: July 2017  Where it stands now: UK-based Liberty House had declared itself the winner, but there are doubts on its eligibility after it came to light that one of its subsidiaries had dues pending before Exim Bank. What is the issue: Liberty House has now paid the dues. So it remains to be seen whether NCLT allows its bid to go through.   Bhushan Steel  Total Debt: Rs 44,000 crore  Date of referral to NCLT: July 2017   Where it stands now: Tata Steel emerges as top bidder after a fierce bidding war, outsmarting JSW Steel. However, the deal not sealed yet. What is the issue: Larsen & Toubro (L&T) has moved NCLT seeking ‘higher priority’ in repayment of dues owed by Bhushan Steel. Bhushan Steel owes Rs 900 crore to L&T for supplies of certain capital goods.   Alok Industries  Total Debt: Rs 29,000 crore  Date of referral to NCLT: June 2017   Where it stands now: Employees have moved NCLT to prevent the company from liquidation as 12,000 employees will lose their jobs. What is the issue: Lenders did not find the sole joint bid of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) with JM Financial Asset Reconstruction Company attractive enough.   Electrosteel    Total Debt: Rs 13,000 crore  Date of referral to NCLT: July 2017   Where it stands now: Vedanta declared winner by NCLT earlier this week, but failed bidder Renaissance Steel has challenged it. What is the issue: Renaissance is challenging Vedanta’s win under Section 29A (d) of the  IBC , a clause that prohibits bidding by entities or their subsidiaries that have been convicted for an offence punishable for more than two years.   Bhushan Power & Steel   Total Debt: Rs 49,200 crore  Date of referral to NCLT: June 2017    Where it stands now: NCLT has directed banks to consider Liberty House’s bid that was initially disallowed because it came in after the deadline. What is the issue: Liberty House bid will now be considered which it claims is higher than that offered by Tata Steel, the current highest bidder shortlisted by lenders.   Monnet Ispat   Total Debt: Rs 10,237 crore  Date of referral to NCLT: June 2017    Where it stands now: The Aion-JSW Steel consortium’s bid has been approved by CoC, and awaits NCLT approval. What is the issue: ArcelorMittal has alleged that the company is not eligible to bid under section 29(A) as promoter Sandeep Jajodia’s wife Seema Jajodia is JSW Group chairman Sajjan Jindal’s sister. She has, however, transferred her shareholding in the company before bidding began.   ABG Shipyard   Total Debt: Rs 18,245 crore  Date of referral to NCLT: July 2017  Where it stands now: Liberty House has emerged as sole bidder in the fourth consecutive round of bidding called by lenders to the ship-builder, the promoters of which face a wilful defaulter tag. What is the issue: Liberty has paid off its dues to Exim Bank to be eligible for bidding. But lenders are not too happy with offer.  "},

Nonetheless, the buoyancy in the markets with the backdrop of softening crude oil prices and peaking inflation needs to play out well, caution experts.  Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst, HDFC Securities, said, “The upmove with range-bound action continued in the market on Tuesday, and Nifty closed higher by 133 points amidst lacklustre type movement. After opening with an upside gap, the market moved up in the early hours. It later shifted to a narrow range movement at the highs which continued till the end”.  Siddhartha Khemka, Head - Retail Research,  Motilal Oswal Financial Services , said: We expect market momentum to continue in the near term with the Nifty heading towards 18,200 zones. Positive global cues, strengthening of the rupee and a drop in 10-year bond yield to five month low are some of the key positives. FIIs have been net buyers for more than the last 3 days.  That said, here’s a look at what some key indicators are suggesting for Tuesday’s action:   Wall Street  slumps after hot inflation data  US Stocks fell sharply on Tuesday after a key August inflation report came in hotter than expected, hurting investor optimism for a less aggressive Federal Reserve.  The S&P 500 sank 2.3% in early trading Tuesday, threatening to snap a four-day winning streak. Bond prices also fell sharply, sending their yields higher, after a report showed inflation decelerated to 8.3% in August, instead of the 8.1% economists expected.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 603 points, or 1.9%, to 31,777, as of 9:45 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite dropped 3.1%.   European markets slide European shares and the euro slid on Tuesday, and European bond yields jumped, after data showed monthly U.S consumer prices unexpectedly rose in August.  The consumer price index gained 0.1% last month after being unchanged in July, the Labor Department said on Tuesday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the CPI dipping 0.1%.  European stocks turned sharply lower, pushing the pan-regional STOXX 600 equity benchmark into negative territory. The index was down 0.3% by 1246 GMT, having risen as much as 0.6% before the data.   Tech View: Small bullish candle The 50-pack index, trading above its key short and long-term averages, formed a small bullish candle on the daily chart, with wicks on both the sides, reflecting the indecisiveness among traders at high.  Analysts see an upside hurdle for the index at 18,150, while immediate support for the index is seen at 17,925-900 levels.   Stocks showing bullish bias Momentum indicator Moving Average Convergence Divergence ( MACD ) showed a bullish trade setup on the counters of Zomato, Vedanta, SAIL, KRBL,  ICICI Bank , Samvardhana etc.  The MACD is known for signaling trend reversals in traded securities or indices. When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement and vice versa.   Stocks signalling weakness ahead The MACD showed bearish signs on the counters of  Federal Bank , TV 18, HFCL,  Rashtriya Chemicals ,  Kotak Mahindra Bank  and  Varun Beverages .  A bearish crossover on the MACD indicated that they had just begun their downward journey.   Most active stocks in value terms Bajaj Finserv  (Rs 1,871 crore), Zomato (Rs 1,295 crore), Adani Enterprises(Rs 1219 crore), RIL (Rs 1074 crore), and  Bajaj Finance  (Rs 1022 crore) were among the most active stocks on NSE in value terms. Higher activity on a counter in value terms can help identify the counters with the highest trading turnovers in the day.   Most active stocks in volume terms Vodafone Idea  (Shares traded: 21.33 crore), Zomato (Shares traded: 19.9 crore), Yes Bank (Shares traded: 11.84 crore),  Suzlon Energy  (Shares traded: 7.45 crore) and PNB (Shares traded: 6.76 crore) were among the most traded stocks in the session on NSE.   Stocks showing buying interest Shares of BLS International Service, KRBL,  Maharashtra Scooter ,  Tata Investment , AllCargo, Rolex etc. witnessed strong buying interest from market participants as they scaled their fresh 52-week highs, signalling bullish sentiment.   Stocks seeing selling pressure Shares of  Alembic Pharma  and  Sanofi India  witnessed strong selling pressure and hit new 52-week lows, signalling bearish sentiment on the counters.   Sentiment meter favours bulls Overall, market breadth favoured winners as 1,818 stocks ended in the green, while 1,677 names settled with cuts.

India Cements  has been the top gainer in the pack by ralling around 44 per cent in the last 3 months. Amid  Adani Group 's acquisition of  ACC  and  Ambuja Cements , the two stocks are now near their 52-week high levels.   Other cement stocks like  JK Cement ,  Dalmia Bharat ,  The Ramco Cements , Nuvoco Vistas and  Ultratech  have rallied in between 22-35 per cent in the last 3 months.    Agencies  Domestic brokerage firm  Motilal Oswal  is bullish on the cement industry dynamics over the next few years, due to better demand prospects, led by infrastructure and housing sector, increased consolidation in the industry, and regulatory changes in the allotment of limestone blocks.  Over the next three-years, the brokerage expects a demand CAGR of approximately 8 per cent, which is likely to surpass installed capacity CAGR of 5.4 per cent.   ICICI Securities  said assuming fuel prices sustain at current levels (or correct further) coupled with price hikes /current price hike absorption, risk-reward is expected to turn favourable in the medium-term perspective as margins or consensus earnings downgrade has likely bottomed out.   Analysts say the industry’s average EBITDA/te could still decline in Q2, turn broadly flat in Q3 and start to inch up from Q4 – both on QoQ and YoY basis - assuming the spread between cement and fuel prices sustains or improves from current levels. “While near-term stock price performance would hinge on the said spread, we believe risk-reward is favourable in the medium-term perspective as margins / consensus earnings downgrades have likely bottomed out,” Harsh Mittal of ICICI Securities said.  The valuations of cement stocks are also not demanding as they are still trading well below their five-year averages, Rakesh Arora of GoIndiaStocks, said. \"UltraTech used to trade at 19-20 times its five-year average. There is no reason why it should trade less because actually the runway is looking much better for growth. So there are hardly any red flags,\" he said.   Top cement stock picks  For Motilal Oswal,  Ultratech Cement  (target price: Rs 7,515) is the top pick in the largecap space. On the midcap side, it has recommended Dalmia Bharat and  Birla Corporation  to its investors.   ICICI Securities’ top picks include Ultratech Cement (target price Rs 8,500) and  Shree Cement  (TP: Rs 25,500). It is also bullish on JK Cement (Rs 3,170) and  JK Lakshmi Cement  (Rs 630).

Among the top gainers,  Nilkamal  advanced nearly 430 per cent to Rs 2,190 on April 25, 2017 from Rs 414 on March 4, 2015.      Other top gainers on the list included  Jubilant Life  (up 410.57 per cent), CPCL (up 403 per cent),  Gayatri Projects  (up 395 per cent),  SpiceJet  (up 379 per cent), Dalmia Bharat (up 342 per cent),  Himatsingka Seide  (up 329 per cent), Navin Fluo (up 327 per cent,  Aegis Logistics  (up 326 per cent),  Can Fin Homes  (up 321 per cent),  Dishman  Pharma (up 313 per cent), Escorts (up 310 per cent) and Mindal Industries (up 300 per cent).

Sectorwise, the BSE Consumer Durables index gained 52 per cent, followed by BSE Oil & Gas (up 49 per cent), FMCG (up 15 per cent), Auto (up 14 per cent) and Realty (up 11.63 per cent). On the other hand, the BSE IT index, Healthcare and Capital Goods slipped 18.99 per cent, 8.30 per cent, 2.87 per cent, respectively, since March 4, 2015.      Jayant Manglik, President, Retail Distribution, Religare Securities, said the market momentum will extend further. “Banking, auto and select NBFCs are leading from the front in this rally. We believe their outperformance will continue going ahead. So align your trades accordingly.”   The BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices soared over 30 per cent each during the same period.    Angel Broking  said the overall  environment  in financial markets across the globe has been quite cheerful in the past couple of days. It seems that the Indian market was awaiting some positive triggers to resume the uptrend and it has done exactly that. Traders are advised to stay on the long side and continue focusing on stocks that have stronger chart structures. "},

His is a rags-to-riches story.", "article": "You can easily place him by his smile. And he swears by SMILE as his investing philosophy.    Vijay Kedia  is better known on Dalal Street for having spotted many a multibaggers such as  Punjab Tractors ,  Cera Sanitaryware ,  Aegis Logistics  and  Atul Auto  pretty early. And he has been at it for long, since 1989.   ALSO READ | Dons of Dalal Street    Kedia says he strictly adheres to SMILE as a principle in investing; which translates into Small in size, Medium in experience, Large in aspiration and Extra-large in market potential.   His is a rags-to-riches story. Kedia came to financial capital Mumbai from the City of Joy, Kolkata, in 1989. His first big bet was an investment of Rs 35,000 in Punjab Tractors, which earned him Rs 1.50 lakh in three years.   He then betted on  ACC , which multiplied his  wealth  10 times. And that kicked off a journey that has left him with a Rs 400 crore portfolio at last count. Kedia today has holdings in around 15 companies.   Kedia has a knack for spotting unpopular and sometimes unheard of stocks. Short-term investment is a big no-no for him. Instead he prefers to play it for the long term.   Aegis Logistics, Cera Sanitaryware and Atul Auto are the best examples of his stock-picking prowess; stocks that have returned up to 100 times in last 10 years.   TRF,  LIC Housing  and Leading Edge (not listed now) also delivered him handsome returns during different times over the past 15 years.   But Kedia counts Punjab Tractors (in 1989), ACC (in 1992), Leading Edge (in 1998), Cera Sanitaryware (in 2004) and Aegis Logistics (in 2005) among his best bets.   One of his latest bets has been Sudarshan Chemicals, which he picked in 2014. He bought 25,55,317 shares in the company at Rs 42 apiece and in three years, the scrip was trading at 10 times that price at Rs 401 on May 16, 2017.      In an exclusive chat with ETMarkets.com, Kedia said while spotting a stock, the company management is the most important issue for him.   “Good managers in bad business are better than bad managers in good business. InterGlobe Aviaton and  Kingfisher  are the best examples,” he said.   On his own performance, Kedia said, “An investor should chase the story behind his investment, not the money on table. Money can make you rich, but story can make you wealthy.”   Despite coming from a joint family-owned stock broking company in Kolkata, Kedia was never interested in broking and parted with his home business at an early age to invest on his own.   “Realising your mistake is knowledge, repeating the mistake is stupidity,” Kedia said.   Kedia identifies 3M - music, meditation and markets – as the core of his life. “Music is the highest degree of meditation,” he said. “You can find Kedia as a singer on YouTube very easily.”   On his journey since the beginning, Kedia said, “I started with the only capital of dream, courage and ambition. Today, these are still my most valuable capital, but thankfully I also have some pocket money to spend. My present portfolio is much better than my portfolio in the last bull market, and it is building up brick by brick just like the saying in Hindi: Boond boond se ghada bharta hai.” "},

But in the broader market, select stocks have risen as much as 11,850 per cent, or 120 times, during this period. The Modi-led National Democratic Alliance government completes three years in office on May 26, 2017.   Data compiled by ETMarkets.com showed 62 stocks on BSE multiplied investor wealth by over 10 times during this period with smallcap firm Ducon Infratechnologies surging the most at 120 times, or 11,851 per cent, to trade at Rs 37.05 as of May 23 from Rs 0.31 as of May 26, 2014.   The gains show an investment of Rs 1 lakh in the stock way back in May 2014 would have become over Rs 1 crore today.      Among other top gainers, Kushal Tradlink,  Uniply Industries  and  Medicamen Biotech  multiplied investor wealth by over 50 times in three years. Shares of  Fiberweb  (India) surged 45 times, or 4,351 per cent, to Rs 344.10 from Rs 7.73 on May 26, 2014.   Mangalam Drugs,  Star Paper Mills  and Kellton Technologies, which were penny stocks back in 2014, are trading in three figures now, having soared over 10 times in these three years.      Eight stocks, including  Tata Metaliks ,  Aegis Logistics ,  Shreyas Shipping  and NR Agarwal Industries, have surged between 850 per cent and 1,000 per cent ever since the Modi sarkar took charge.   Over 40 stocks on the exchange surged between 1,000 per cent and 2000 per cent. They include several popular stocks such as  Indo Count Industries  (up 1,080 per cent),  Minda Industries  (up 1,074 per cent),  Dwarikesh Sugar  (up 1207 per cent),  Caplin Point  (up 1,488 per cent) and  Tasty Bite  (up 1,940 per cent).   Since May 26, 2014, the BSE Sensex advanced 23 per cent till May 23, 2017, whereas BSE Midcap index and BSE Smallcap index have risen 68 per cent and 66 per cent, respectively.      Analysts on Dalal Street feel the Modi government has done a good job in enacting the much-needed reforms in key sectors, aimed at putting the economy on the path of faster growth.   Equity investors have given thumbs up to these initiatives and, consequently, helping the benchmark indices to go on an upward trajectory.   The good part is, this hasn’t been a two-steps forward, one-step back kind of government, says  Crisil , an analytical company providing ratings and research.   The steps taken by the Modi government do not create an immediate and strong upside for growth, but they improve India’s ability to achieve faster and, importantly, sustainable growth over the medium term, the rating agency said.   Market veterans are bullish on the remaining two years of the Modi government. They see over 40 per cent upside for the equity indices over the next two years.   The domestic market should give 25 per cent kind of return over the next two years, said G Chokkalingam, Founder, Equinomics Research and Advisory.   AK Prabhakar of IDBI Capital projects Nifty to surpass the 14,000 mark by May, 2019. "},

Dalal Street is full of experts who have a knack for spotting such  stocks , many of which have the potential to deliver  multibagger  returns.   A good number of companies listed on the bourses have announced their shareholding patterns for the June quarter ended June 30, 2017. Based on these details, we tried to spot the stocks that ace investors bought during the quarter even as the  benchmark  indices headed for their lifetime highs.   Dolly Khanna    Chennai-based marquee investor Dolly Khanna, whose portfolio is entirely managed by her husband Rajiv Khanna, remained busy in churning her portfolio during the previous quarter ended June 30, 2017. Khanna has a knack for identifying lesser-known quality stocks at the right time to bet for multibagger return.   During Q1FY17, Khanna increased stake in  Dwarikesh Sugar  from 1.18 per cent as of March 31, 2017 to 1.49 per cent as of June 30, 2017.   Besides Dwarikesh Sugar, the data available with corporate database Capitaline showed that Khanna also bought some shares in  LT Foods ,  Nahar Industrial ,  Nitin Spinners ,  NOCIL ,  RSWM ,  Ruchira Papers  and  Tata Metaliks .  Rain Industries is the new addition in her portfolio. She acquired 1.27 per cent, or 42.68 lakh shares in Rain during April-June 2017. Khanna also entered  Shreyans Industries  with a holding of 1,51,285 (1.09 per cent) shares in Q1. Khanna has been investing in the domestic  stock market  since 1996.   Rakesh  Jhunjhunwala    June quarter shareholding data available so far suggests the ace investor (& family) hardly made any change to his holdings in the 16 stocks he holds. That, even when half of them showed signs of weakness and performed badly through the quarter. There are about 30 listed companies where Jhunjhunwala owns more than one per cent stake.   Data available for the 16 Jhunjhunwala portfolio stocks showed the ace investor did some tinkering on the  Aurobindo Pharma  counter, but left the other 15 untouched despite up to 28 per cent fall in eight of them during the quarter. He increased his stake in Aurobindo Pharma from 1.08 per cent as of March 2017 to 1.12 per cent as of June 2017. (for detailed report: http://bit.ly/2tpgidw)   Ashish Kacholia    Well-known stock picker Ashish  Kacholia  kicked off his career with  Prime Securities  and later moved to Edelweiss’ equity research desk. After this, he started his own broking firm named as Lucky Securities. From 2003, Kacholia started focusing on building his own portfolio.   Some of his holdings gave more than 1,000 per cent returns. The stock picker increased stake in NOCIL (from 2.82 per cent as of March 2017 to 3.13 per cent as of June 2017), followed by  Aptech  and Mold-Teck Pack. On the other hand, he reduced his stake in  GHCL ,  KEI Industries  and  Shreyas Shipping .   Vijay Kedia    Vijay Kedia is better known for having spotted many a multibaggers such as  Punjab Tractors ,  Cera Sanitaryware ,  Aegis Logistics  and  Atul Auto  pretty early.

However, if the index does manage to close above the 9,950 levels, then it could head back to 10,200-10,300 levels. Cement, metal, auto and banking sectors are expected to show strength in the coming weeks.   NAGARAJ SHETTI, TECHNICAL RESEARCH ANALYST, HDFC SECURITIES    What is in Store?   The recent bounce in the  market  seems to have completed as Nifty reversed down sharply. We observe a formation of lower tops and bottoms in smaller degree as per daily time frame and the recent swing high of 9947 (Aug 17) could be considered as a new lower top in the sequence. Nifty as per weekly time frame had formed a significant top reversal pattern of `bearish engulfing' during week before last but has formed consolidation type pattern with positive bias during last week.The formation of large negative candle on weekly charts is an exceptional reversal formation of the uptrend of last few months. Hence this could be considered as an important top reversal pattern near the all-time high of 10137 levels. Immediate weekly support of uptrend line (at 9850) has been broken down and that broken support area is currently acting as a resistance. The theory of Fibonacci retracement are suggesting that this down move could extend down to 50% Fibonacci retracement (around 9,000 levels) of the previous large rise over a period of time. This expected action of Nifty is in line with the presence of ascending larger support line, strong valuation area and the equality of prior down moves (as per monthly time frame).   What Could Investors Do?   There is a possibility of Nifty showing further weakness and it is likely to retest the key lower support of around 9700-9680 levels possibly by this week. The support area of 9700 could offer minor buying interest again from the lows, but that support could eventually be broken on the downside in the next 1-2 weeks.The overall negative chart pattern with other negative technical aspects as per larger time frame is now opening up the downside target for Nifty of around 9000 levels in the next couple of months. Banking, realty, auto, capital goods, metal and mid & small cap sectors could underperform. However, FMCG, healthcare and oil & gas could be resilient during a broader market down trend.   SWAPNEEL MANTRI, TECHNICAL ANALYST - INSTITUTIONS, SUSHIL FINANCE    Where are We?   The week gone by saw bouts of volatility.Nifty largely traded below 10,000 levels closing the week at 9837 levels.   What is in Store?   Expect range bound trading to continue on the index, with 9920-9950 resistance zone on the upside and 9820-9790 support zone on the downside. A close above 9950 levels may see Nifty heading back above 10000 levels to 10200-10300.   What Could Investors Do?   The much needed cool-off in markets has presented a good buying opportunity in some of the quality frontline and midcap stocks. Investors can make the most of the current market lull by accumulating quality scrips at lower levels and consolidating their portfolio holdings. Among the frontline counters  ITC  offers a good buying range and one can accumulate the scrip at current level for higher target of `302-320. Container Corp is another such counter which has given a good breakout and can be accumulated at current levels for higher targets of `1420 in the medium term. Among the PSU counters,  GAIL  and Dredging Corp offer good accumulating opportunity at current levels for higher targets of `410, `690, respectively. Some of the midcaps like Alkem Labs,  Aegis Logistics ,  Crompton Greaves ,  CDSL , HUDCO, RCF offer good entry points at current levels for a good short to medium term appreciation. Sector specific,  Nifty Pharma  has formed positive  RSI  on daily charts and is showing signs of trend reversal.Investors can look at accumulating the beaten-down counters like DRL,  Sun Pharma ,  Lupin  for good appreciation from a long-term point of view.   RAJESH PALVIYA, HEAD ­ TECHNICAL & DERIVATIVES ANALYST, AXIS SECURITIES    What is in Store?   Last week, Nifty has witnessed strong buying momentum.It has formed bullish gap 9825-9855 on daily chart, which is likely to act as immediate support for any minor corrective action in near term.Pharma, cement and banking sectors have shown good buying interest. The chart pattern suggests that Nifty is likely to continue its uptrend in near term and it can scale up towards 995010100 level in near term; any weekly close above 10100 would initiate euphoric buying which would lead the index towards 10250-10400 levels in short medium term. However, any minor profit booking would get support around 9825-9730 levels. If the Nifty breaks below 9730, then it may drift down towards 9650-9500 in short term. It is expected to trade in 970010100 range in forthcoming weeks with a positive bias.   What Should Investors Do?   Nifty continues to exhibit bullishness and is exhibiting strength to scale up toward 9950-10050 in coming weeks as it is sustaining above 9800 level.On the down side, 9730 is likely to act as strong support for any corrective action; any breakdown below this level will accelerate the selling pressure and Nifty may drift down towards the levels of 9650-9500 in short term. We advise buying stocks, if Nifty corrects in nearshort term to 9730-9650 which is a strong support zone. Cement, metal, automobile and banking are expected to show strength in the coming weeks. "},

Optimism in the sector was also fuelled by reports of a possible 6-7 per cent hike in prices undertaken by companies from August.

With this alternative paper sector gets an undue advantage, leading to high demand, he said.  We remain a bit cautious as historically such bans have not been appropriately enforced.

For the backward integrated paper mills such as JK Paper, West Coast Paper and Andhra Paper, the inflation in FY22 was largely on account of power & fuel cost, stores, chemicals and spares cost and employee cost,\" it added.

For Ambuja Cement, 5.66 lakh shares, or 0.11% of the company's shares, were tendered as on Thursday.", "article": "Mumbai: The mandatory offers by  Adani Group  to buy the stakes of public shareholders of  ACC  and  Ambuja Cement  soon after acquiring the majority holdings in the  companies  have received modest response so far. The open offer by the Gautam Adani-owned conglomerate to buy out 26% each in the two cement makers, which started on August 26, will close on September 9.  Out of the 4.9 crore  ACC  shares that the Adani Group offered to buy, 25.31 lakh shares were tendered as on September 8 - a day before the open offer ended. This amounts to 5.17% of the shares that it is prepared to buy. For Ambuja Cement, 5.66 lakh shares, or 0.11% of the company's shares, were tendered as on Thursday.  As per the shares tendered on Thursday, Adani Group will have to shell out ₹604 crore for the  open offers  from the ₹31,140-crore they had set aside.  The group offered to buy 26% of Ambuja Cement for ₹385 per share. Shares of Ambuja Cement ended at ₹461.75 on Thursday, a 20.13% premium to the offer price.  In the case of ACC, the offer price is ₹2,300 per share. ACC shares closed at ₹2,420, a 5.3% premium to the offer price.  Brokers see the likelihood of more participation in the ACC open offer on the last day because of the premium to the offer price.  Sebi rules require acquirers to make a mandatory offer to buy at least 26% stake from public shareholders if they buy 25% or more in a listed company. The rule is aimed at giving minority investors an exit option during the buyout.  In May, Adani Group announced to buy both the companies from Holcim for little over $10.5 billion.  The deal was India’s largest-ever M&A transaction in the infrastructure and materials space.  For Ambuja Cement, Adani had made an open offer to its public shareholders to acquire up to 516.3 million shares, representing 26% of the expanded share capital for 19,879.57 crore.  In the case of ACC, the group had offered to acquire up to 48.9 million shares held by public shareholders, representing 26% of the expanded share capital for 11,259.97 crore.  On completion of the deal, Adani Group stands to become the second-largest cement maker in the country with a combined pan India capacity of 66 million tonnes per annum (mtpa).  Last month, CLSA said shares of ACC and Ambuja Cement were likely to underperform after the conclusion of the ongoing open offer by Adani Group. The brokerage said the focus is likely to shift back to earnings and growth outlook, post open offer.  Analysts are, however, advising investors to hold on to ACC and Ambuja Cement.  “Given that the outlook for the cement sector is good in the mid- to-long term, investors should hold both the stocks,” said Gaurav Dua, head of capital market strategy at Sharekhan.  According to Sanjeev Kumar Singh, analyst at Motilal Oswal Financial Services, cement industry dynamics over the next few years look good due to better demand prospects. “Over the next three years, we expect a demand CAGR (compounded annual growth rate) of 8%, likely to surpass installed capacity CAGR of 5.4%,” he said.

Andhra Cements' lenders received expressions of interest from Sagar Cements, B C Jindal's  Jindal Poly Films , Dalmia Cement (Bharat) Ltd and  Khandwala Finstock Pvt Ltd , according to a stock exchange disclosure.  Hyderabad-based asset reconstruction company (ARC) Pridhvi Asset Reconstruction and Securitisation Company (Paras) had acquired ₹1,012 crore in principal loans from  Edelweiss  ARC and  Karur Vysya Bank  in September last year for ₹434.6 crore, said the people cited above.  The acquisition by Paras was financially supported by stock exchange-listed Sagar Cements, the people said.   Paras has an 86% share of verified debt;  Union Bank of India and State Bank of India  have about 11% and 3%, respectively, of the financial claims. Through this bankruptcy resolution, lenders hope to recover about 40-45% of their claims.   Sagar Cements, Paras and the resolution professional did not respond to ET's requests for comments.   Deloitte-backed RP Nirav Pujara has admitted ₹1,356 crore by way of claims from financial creditors. Sagar Cements would have to shell out more if it were to acquire Andhra Cements outside the ambit of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, one of the persons cited above said.   First, since Andhra Cements is listed, Sagar Cements would be required to make an open offer to the public immediately after buying 25% of the equity in it. Second, it would be liable to pay the entire government and trade creditors' dues.  However, upon being admitted for insolvency, operational creditors and the government authorities have to accept the haircut offered by the successful bidder, thus lowering the acquisition cost.  Having acquired majority debt, Paras could control all the resolutions passed by the committee of creditors. Under insolvency proceedings, a critical resolution can be passed only if 66% of the creditors, by the value of debt, vote in favour of the resolution.  According to its latest annual report, Sagar Cements has a production capacity of 8.25mtpa (metric tonne per annum) at the end of March 2022, and its plans to achieve 10 mtpa capacity by FY25. It has three integrated cement plants, two grinding units and two captive power thermal plants. It has a total debt of ₹1,503 crore.  "},

The  regulator  conducted a probe between March 2015 and September 2015 in the scrip of CTL and found that Amtek had pledged 8.15 crore shares during the September 2015 quarter.  Besides, Amtek had pledged shares of CTL on five other occasions also.  The regulator said Amtek was duty-bound to disclose the six transactions of invocation of pledge of the shares within seven working days to the stock exchanges and CTL under SAST (Substantial Acquisition of shares and Taekovers) norms and insider trading regulations.  Besides, during the December 2015 quarter, the holding of Amtek changed from 36.01 per cent to 3.636 per cent which required the firm to disclose to the CTL and exchanges under SAST and insider  trading norms .  However, on both the occasions, it failed to do so, said the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi). Thereby, the regulator violated SAST and insider Trading norms, it said.  Accordingly, a fine of Rs 20 lakh was imposed on Amtek Auto for violating SAST norms and Rs 4 lakh for insider trading norms.  In a separate order, Sebi barred Sharex Dynamic India Pvt Ltd from accepting any fresh client for one month for violating RTA (Registrars to an Issue and Share Transfer Agent) regulations.  According to the order, an inspection of the books of  accounts  of Sharex was conducted by an auditor appointed by Sebi, for the financial years 2013-14 to 2015-16.  The auditors found that RTA agent, Sharex had processed transfer of shares, despite significant mismatch between the signature of transferor and his specimen signature.  Moreover, it had processed transfer of shares without having specimen signature record.  By doing so, Sharex violated relevant circulars and RTA norms, Sebi said.

A person closely associated with the company's resolution said that while there is still interest in the market for the asset, the condition of the automobile market that is currently “down in the dumps” is discouraging buyers to show active interest at this time.  “...even so, some players have shown some interest and others are being reached out to,” the person said.  Amtek Auto owes more than Rs 12,000 crore to lenders and was admitted for insolvency resolution in July, 2017. It was one of the 12 assets the Reserve Bank of India listed as being in need of urgent resolution. At the time when the company was admitted and until last year,  auto sales  were enjoying double digit growth and major players like Bharat Forge, US-based investors like  Deccan Value Investors  and  KKR  had expressed initial interest.  The auto component industry has de-grown by more than 21% in the first four months of this fiscal. ET reported last month that the industry has put on hold at least $2 billion (?14,186 crore) worth of investment planned for this year.  On Tuesday, ratings agency ICRA revised its outlook on the auto component sector to ‘negative’. “Most players are taking a relook at their capital expenditure plans; consequently, across segments ICRA estimates a cut back ranging between 15-25% by most players”, Subrata Ray, head of corporate sector ratings at ICRA, said in a report.  The resolution has already crossed the deadline of 270 days, thrown off rails by winning bidder Liberty House that refused to pay up alleging “serious discrepancies” in the information during the due diligence process and what actually existed on ground.  In August, the companies appellate tribunal ordered liquidation of the asset which was quashed by the apex court on September 26. The court asked for the process to begin all over again and has given the resolution professional Dinkar Venkatasubramanian of EY 21 days to invite fresh bids and complete the process two weeks after that.

Banks will finally be able to keep out unscrupulous promoters with the law establishing the primacy of financial lenders on asset proceeds.", "article": "More than two years ago, the Reserve Bank of India ordered local banks to take Essar Steel and 11 other borrowers to ‘trials’ under a revamped bankruptcy law enacted in late 2016. The jury is finally out on India’s most significant piece of bad loan legislation: It has, unequivocally, recognised the primacy of secured creditors in asset-sale proceeds.  But the ride so far has been rather rocky, testing the patience of all stakeholders. So much so that the chair of the country’s largest lender, State Bank of India, had invoked divine intervention just three months ago, expressing his disappointment with the progress on bankruptcy cases — and their evident reflection in the masslender’s quarterly financial statements.  “Every morning I am looking at the sky and praying to God that the three large NCLT accounts stuck in the middle of resolution get resolved — these alone will give us more than Rs 16,000 crore in write-backs,”  SBI  chairman Rajnish Kumar had said in August, referring to Essar Steel, Bhushan Power and Steel and Alok Industries, where SBI has made 100% provisions against bad loans.  Kumar can now breathe a sigh of relief, with his bank getting more than Rs 12,000 crore in recoveries on the provisions.  “This much awaited judgement (on the primacy of lenders) also settles numerous points of law under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code — points that were tested in various courts,” Kumar said. “This should significantly reduce the scope for long-drawn litigations under  IBC  and would eventually lead to faster resolution of stressed assets.”   SECURED VS OPERATIONAL CREDITORS  Last Friday, in its 164-page verdict in the case of Essar Steel, the Supreme Court not only upheld that the ultimate discretion on distribution of funds lies with the Committee of Creditors (CoC), but also ratified that the rights of secured and unsecured financial creditors are different when it comes to payment claims on resolution proceeds.  “The Essar ruling is like the Kesavananda Bharati case, where the basic structure of the Constitution was defined,” said Hari Hara Mishra, director, UV Asset Reconstruction Company.  This ruling has also reinforced that the distribution of bid proceeds shall be in accordance with the provisions of the bankruptcy code and the resolution plan approved by majority of creditors, making it clear that equity holders have no right on claims.  “This has led to a narrowing down in the scope for interpretation and interference by the authorities,” said Ashish Pyasi, associate partner, Dhir and Dhir Associates. “This would also mean that now the commercial wisdom of committee of creditors will prevail and there is no equity as the interest of all stakeholders, including the operational creditors, has been taken care of in the amendment and the validity of same has also been tested by the Supreme Court in this ruling.”   TESTING OUR RESOLVE  For the bankruptcy mechanism, the journey over the past three years has been anything but smooth. It has faced obstacles from the word go. Not only were the biggest bad loan cases embroiled in litigation, but there have also been several issues about the interpretation of the law. Lenders were under constant fear that bankruptcy matters could get stuck in superior courts and then languish for months on delays caused by pendency and adjournments.  Since the IBC was first implemented in May 2016, the government has brought about several changes in the law, including giving powers to the Reserve Bank of India to send cases into bankruptcy, blocking errant promoters from bidding and allowing exits from the code with maximum CoC vote. History has shown that India has been rather poor in implementing laws such as SICA, BIFR, DRT or Sarfaesi, but the jinx seems to have been finally broken.  “This is a landmark judgment and it sets very positive precedence for banks that there is hope with IBC as a lot of assets undergoing resolution were solid assets with good recovery potential,” says CV Rajendran, MD,  Catholic Syrian Bank .    Promoters of large bankrupt companies were steadfastly resisting loss of control over their business, and they also challenged the constitutional validity of the law. That contention was later shot down by the apex court, which held that the law does not infringe upon individual or fundamental rights.  But this does not mean the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code has failed to make a mark. Prior to IBC, no one would have imagined that the likes of Ruias, Dhoots, Singhals, Miglanis or Dhams would be ousted from companies that were symbolic to their very existence.  NEW TIMELINES  The Essar Steel judgement has come as a breather for 535 corporate debtors facing liquidation by December. The earlier rules allowed cases to be settled within 270 days, a deadline later relaxed to 330 days. Now, the apex court has held that if the debts are not resolved within this time frame, bankruptcy tribunals could award extension of time under exceptional circumstances. There are 1,497 cases pending in IBC. Of these, 535 cases have been in the resolution process for more than 270 days.  “By December, all these 535 cases would have crossed an additional 90 days over 270 days and forced into liquidation,” says Mishra. “Forced liquidation is likely to be stopped by this Supreme Court judgement. There is fresh breather for companies completing 330 days in the December quarter.”   INDIAN STRETCHABLE TIME  The number of companies undergoing insolvency reached 1,497 as on end of September 2019, an alltime high. But timelines for these cases continued to get stretched, with 36% of the on-going cases already having crossed 270 days. An ICRA analysis showed that the average time taken for cases to yield a resolution plan was 374 days.  Until September 30, 2019, 1,045 cases of defaulting corporate debtors had been closed under the IBC. Of the same, 56% (587) were ordered into liquidation, while 15% (156) cases yielded a resolution plan In terms of resolution of the 12 large accounts – the claims are of Rs 3.45 lakh crore and these were ordered into IBC by Mint Road – the resolution plans for seven accounts have been approved and orders for liquidation have been made on two accounts. They had liquidation value of Rs 73,220 crore.  Lanco Infratech  and  ABG Shipyard  are under liquidation, while the resolution process for  Amtek Auto , Era Infra and Jaypee Infratech is currently on.  AN END TO LITIGATIONS?  As matters stand, it may be a state of the glass being half full for the apex court, which has now set the broad contours of primacy in badloan resolutions, implying speedier resolutions and a more well-defined waterfall for sale proceeds. But in a country where promoters have been held invincible, a no-nonsense attitude by lenders will go a long way in smashing decades-old practices.  “This will not be end of litigations,” said Abhishek Dafria, analyst, ICRA. “Questions raised by NCLAT have been answered by the Supreme Court and it will help in many cases. Over time, we will see more resolutions, and the way bankruptcy is handled in the country will take a few more years before the process is cemented.” "},

The lenders, led by  Union Bank of India , have cited contempt of court because the apex court had in an earlier ruling rejected Deccan Value Investors’ plea for time to re-evaluate its offer. “The application made by the applicant for withdrawal of the offer is hereby rejected and in case he indulges in such kind of practice, it will be treated as contempt of this court in view of various orders passed by this court at his instance,” a June 18 order of the Supreme Court reads.  The order was pronounced in response to an application from DVI claiming that the pandemic had drastically altered the financial calculations that were the basis for its previous offer.  Force majeure is where unforeseeable circumstances prevent someone from fulfilling a contract, and is typically invoked during events such as natural disasters.  In a response to ET’s queries, DVI said the pandemic had rendered its commercial assumptions for the company “redundant”.

One such CP related to an ongoing dispute between the creditors and leaseholders of a key plot of land on which Amtek’s manufacturing facilities stand. All of these matters will now be adjudicated by the courts. Deccan Value Investors is confident of its position and looks forward to a final outcome that upholds the sanctity of contract under the IBC,” the company said.  The Supreme Court’s proceedings could have an impact on multiple insolvency cases where bidders have invoked force majeure clauses to nullify previously made commercial commitments, on the grounds that Covid-19 had affected their financial calculations.  Most notably, bids for Essar Projects, Bhushan Power and Steel and Avantha group’s power projects have run into hurdles due to the pandemic.  DVI’s bid for Amtek Auto has already been approved by the National Company Law Tribunal.  The auto parts maker was among the first 12 accounts selected by the Reserve Bank of India for insolvency proceedings when the IBC legislation kicked-off.  Amtek Auto’s insolvency has been a long-drawn event and a second round of bidding was carried out for the company after certain suitors in the first round reneged on their offers. DVI was selected in the second round of bidding that concluded in January this year.  The auto parts maker owes banks around Rs 13,000 crore. DVI had also made an offer for Metalyst Forgings, an associate company of Amtek Auto.  Auto parts makers have been lobbying for greater relief from the government for the purposes of restructuring their loans, claiming adverse effects from the pandemic. "},

What may be among the first of the verdicts could also be one of the most important: the  Supreme Court  may decide within weeks on requests by big borrowers seeking relief on repayments and defaults, in what’s being called the loan moratorium case. Courts also need to rule on pending bankruptcies whose resolution in the coming year could bring billions of dollars of much needed cash to banks.  The legal tussles pit India’s lenders, central bank and government against corporate borrowers struggling to survive amid lockdowns prompted by Covid-19. Companies are asking for more relief as the  Reserve Bank of India  forecasts the economy will shrink by 7.5 per cent this fiscal year, but that could cause a deeper hit for lenders than the central bank is willing to allow.   Loan moratorium case  The Supreme Court in December completed hearing arguments in the case that lasted for around two months. It’s expected to give a verdict in coming weeks, though no date has been announced.  In the same case, the top court will also rule on petitions by the central bank and lenders to lift an order that barred banks from marking  loans  as non-performing assets. Read more background here.   Why it matters  Courts have recently issued orders favorable for borrowers, including barring lenders from selling pledged assets and stopping banks from marking accounts as bad loans. The top court also urged the government to subsidize a 65 billion rupee ($886 million) interest waiver for small borrowers.  Some argue that India’s banks, already stuck with one of the world’s biggest bad-debt piles, would be even more reluctant to lend if courts issue orders that conflict with their contracts.  Courts’ “borrower-friendly” approach despite clear contractual terms was among the biggest reasons for legal troubles for banks in 2020, said Veena Sivaramakrishnan, a partner at law firm Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co. Banks would seek certainty in enforcing contracts and “would expect the courts and the judiciary to also respect the same to continue to provide financing,” she said.  Allowing banks to mark bad loans again would help uncover the impact of the lockdowns on their financial health. The central bank, lenders and the federal government have also urged the top court to not grant more relief to borrowers because that’s a matter to be decided with economic policy. Authorities unveiled from March measures to assist companies including a six-month moratorium on loan repayments and a bar on bankruptcy filings for a year.   Major bankruptcy cases  Half of the so called “dirty dozen” -- 12 big bankruptcy filings in 2017 -- are yet to be resolved. Three of them are pending in the top court and may reach a verdict in the coming year. These are the next tentative hearing dates, though rulings could possibly take months:    Jan. 11:   Amtek Auto Ltd.  The auto parts manufacturer owes banks about $1.7 billion. While the  National Company Law Tribunal  earlier this year approved a bid led by U.S.-based hedge fund Deccan Value Investors LP to take over the company, the fund has since attempted to withdraw from that plan. The top court will decide whether to allow that and if banks should be asked to conduct another round of bidding.  Jan. 13:  Bhushan Power & Steel Ltd. The court will decide whether to allow a planned purchase of the firm by  JSW Steel Ltd.  to go ahead. If the deal does go through, it could fetch banks about $2.6 billion.  No date set yet:   Jaypee Infratech Ltd. , the largest real estate bankruptcy in India. If the top court finalizes a takeover bid from NBCC Ltd. for the company, then banks would get assets worth about $3.2 billion, according to bankruptcy regulator Insolvency and  Bankruptcy Board of India .

Centrum Broking said execution picked up for the company led by strong order backlog and improved labour availability. That said, its margins for the quarter may remain under pressure due to lower efficiency and likely provisions towards certain legacy projects.  Safari Industries, Bharat Dynamics and Granules India are among other companies where domestic fund houses hiked stakes by over 100 basis points during the quarter gone by. Analysts are positive on Bharat Dynamics and Granules India.   JM Financial projects its price target for Bharat Dynamics at Rs 150 based on 16 times FY23 EPS.  We derive comfort on a healthy order backlog of Rs 53,000 crore (4 times TTM sales), strong order pipeline and rampup non-defence revenues (smart city, medical equipment) and service income. Any changes to the cost plus margin structure on nominated orders may be a positive trigger,” JM Financial said.  In the case of Granules India, Q4 profit is seen growing 39 per cent mainly due to operating leverage and a lower tax rate.  Revenue for this firm is seen growing 27 per cent to Rs 760 crore, with Ebitda margin projected to expand 625 bps to 23 per cent.  Overall, out of 431 companies reporting March quarter shareholding patterns so far, 44 saw a rise in MF holdings, 62 saw a drop in fund exposure, while there was no change in shareholdings in the rest.

Gains were led by shares in small-cap companies, chip makers and transportation providers – businesses that stand to gain as the United States emerges from the pandemic recession.   Inflation fears roil European markets  European stocks slid in Thursday’s trade, as a rapid rise in US inflation spooked investors, while a drop in commodity prices weighed on heavyweight miners. The pan-European STOXX 600 index fell 1.6 per cent initially, but later recovered to trade flat. European stocks have rallied to all-time highs this month, with the STOXX 600 up almost 10 per cent so far this year as economic recovery prospects and strong earnings drew buyers of equities.   Nifty may find support at 14,620  Nifty on Wednesday fell below the 14,700 level, and in the process breached a few crucial supports, including the 50-day moving average. The index ended up forming a Bearish Belt Hold pattern, which suggested bear domination over the bulls. Analysts said the next support for the index lies in the 14,620-14,600 range. They continue to see resistance for the index in the 15,000-15,050 zone. Aditya Agarwala of YES Securities said the 20-DMA for the index now lies at 14,620 level. It will be critical to watch out for support in the 14,650-14,600 zone and see whether the bulls are able to push the index back above 14,800 level.

Banks will now move to complete documents and seek regulatory approvals to conclude the resolution that has been hanging for nearly four-and-a-half years.  The  money  was transferred on Wednesday evening to a New Delhi-based  State Bank of India  account in two tranches of ₹100 crore and Rs 400 crore each, two people familiar with the transaction told ET. With the transfer of the amount, banks will now move to finally close the resolution for the Delhi-based sick firm.  We have received the money and can now say that the deal can be closed. There are some technical issues that need to be sorted out, which we will now work out. But those are small issues. The main event was receiving the cash, which has now happened,\" said one of the persons cited above.  DVIL paid up after a direction from the Supreme Court (SC), which had given DVIL 24 hours to make its Rs 500 crore cash payment on Tuesday. In a hearing on Thursday, the SC asked banks to expedite the process for completion of the deal.  In February 2020, lenders led by IDBI Bank and State Bank of India agreed to a Rs 2,700 crore offer from the US-based investor, a 79% haircut on Rs 12,700 crore of dues owed by Amtek to lenders. Only 4% of the recovery is through cash at Rs 500 crore. DVIL has also submitted a Rs 300 crore bank guarantee to lenders.  Besides cash, the deal includes ₹300 crore of optionally convertible debentures (OCDs) and some equity stake of some foreign subsidiaries. But the main amount of recovery is through pass-through certificates (PTCs) worth about Rs 1,800 crore, which lenders will get only after DVIL raises money by selling some assets like machinery, land or equity stakes owned by the company.  Some lenders will need Reserve Bank of India (RBI) permission to create a charge over external commercial borrowings (ECBs) issued by the company earlier. Also to be worked out is the way the PTCs will be structured as banks will not want to carry forward any tax implications from any future payments DVIL would want to make through the sale of some assets.  Since lenders had agreed to the deal as far back as February 2020, it will have to be fine-tuned to the current scenario. The liabilities from the ECB that Amtek has raised from some lenders have to be transferred to DVIL. Then there are clarifications to be sought about the tax implications for the PTCs, which will be issued to lenders. All these issues will now be sorted out. We are confident that the deal will be completed by the end of 2021,\" said a second person aware of the transaction.  Amtek was among the 12 debt-laden companies taken to the National Company Law Tribunal on the directions of RBI way back in July 2017.   DVIL was itself selected in a second bid process to find a buyer for the company after the previous winner, UK-based Liberty House, failed to make the payment in July 2018.  "},

European markets nudge higher Europe's stock markets and Britain's pound both clawed higher on Tuesday as the rampant surge in gas prices stalled, though it could not stop bond market borrowing costs rising again or save the Japanese yen from a new 24-year low.  The euro was sliding again having failed to get back above parity against the dollar. The STOXX 600's bounce remained a modest 0.5%, while a dip in euro zone bond yields sparked by the ECB chatter did not stop US, British and other European ones from climbing again.

Among the top smallcap plays on Dalal Street, 30 companies with stable  return on equity  (RoE) and return on capital employed (RoCE) have surged up to 8,500 per cent over the past five years.   All these companies had a debt-to-equity ratio of less than 1 and have been maintaining RoE and RoCE of over 20 per cent since 2012-13.    Avanti Feeds  emerged the chart topper, with an 8,527 per cent gain to Rs 2,596.60 as of November 28 from Rs 30.10 on November 27, 2012. The company’s return on equity for FY17, FY16, FY15, FY14 and FY13 stood at 42.65 per cent, 46.21 per cent, 52.41 per cent, 45.79 per cent and 27.60 per cent, respectively.  Avanti  also managed to achieve a return on capital employed of over 50 per cent in last four years. Its RoCE stood at 28.59 per cent in FY13.   RoE measures net income earned for every rupee of shareholder funds, while RoCE is the measure of  earnings  before interest and taxes (EBIT) for every rupee of capital (equity and debt) employed in the company. So, RoE holds relevance for returns generated for equity shareholders while RoCE effectively measures the capital efficiency of a company.   Market  mavens  say the current financial year has proven to be a great one for Avanti Feeds so far, both in terms of sales and profitability, which has in turn strengthened its  balance sheet  further.   The company had net cash of Rs 650 crore (H1FY18) and is currently looking at various options to deploy the same.   “We remain bullish on Avanti’s medium- to long-term prospects,” Equirus Securities said in a research report. “But we remain watchful of raw material prices even though they remain benign as of now. We roll over to a March 2019 target price of Rs 2,950 based on 28X TTM EPS of Rs 105 (Dec 2018 target price of Rs 2,450 earlier),” it said.      Textile player  Indo Count Industries  and basmati rice manufacturer and exporter Chamanlal Setia advanced 4,376 per cent and 1,878 per cent, respectively, between November 2012 and this November.

The scrip traded at Rs 122 on November 27.   “We believe softening of  cotton  prices is likely to provide some relief to Indo Count going forward. The volume offtake in the seasonally strong second half remains a key monitorable. We ascribe a PE of 12 times FY19E to arrive at our fair value of Rs 145 per share,” JM Financial said in a research report.

Yes Securities is positive on  La Opala  RG with a target price of Rs 640. Over the past five years, average free cash flow generation stood at Rs 28 crore. With good cash generation, the company has been able to pay off debt (aided by private place in FY15).  With this, La Opala became a net cash company in FY17. As of end March 2017, the company’s balance sheet size was a little over Rs 130 crore.

Relaxo Footwears  registered strong performance in Q2 of FY2018 with revenue and net profit growing in double digits. There are expectations that the goods and services tax ( GST ) would prove to be beneficial for the organised footwear industry due to a shift in demand from the unorganised sector. Sharekhan is bullish on Relaxo with a price target of Rs 645.   Kotak Securities expects  Kajaria  to improve its  market share  by capturing the  market  share of unorganised players as well as with improvement in product mix. Its enhanced presence in tier 2/3/4 cities, strong dealer network, value-added products as well as improvement in capacity utilisation of its joint venture plants are expected to aid revenue growth going forward, the brokerage said.

However, there was some sector-wise polarised performance. At one end, sectors such as IT, cement and commodities continued to do quite well; on the other hand, pharma and auto sectors remained under pressure and weak performance was reported by a couple of frontline companies in the sectors.  There has been incessant selling by overseas investors, but the line-up of IPOs, which were received quite well by the markets, helped the markets sustain the positivity, said an analyst.  “The factors that have been at the core of market activity are the recent rise in virus cases indicating a probable revival in the near future, the Fed stance on monetary policy turning more foggy with higher inflation and better growth numbers, and the enhancement of Chinese regulatory oversight mainly on tech, and edutech companies, while a political and military stance against China is gaining ground gradually elsewhere,” said Joseph Thomas, Head Of Research, Emkay Wealth Management.

Auto sales From today onwards, auto companies will start publishing their July sales data that will lead to some stock specific movement from the sector. In the last couple of months, many companies have decided to hike prices, which may have an impact on the sales data.   RBI policy meet  The RBI’s MPC meeting is scheduled in the coming week, however, the expectation is that the RBI, just like the US Fed, will not hamper the repo rates so as to continue supporting impacted sectors with cheaper credit. The Governor's comments on inflation will also throw some light onto our economy and any future actions our central bank might take.

Windlas Biotech, Devyani International, Krsnaa Diagnostics and Exxaro Tiles will together attempt to raise Rs 3,614 crirefrom primary market investors. Given the enthusiasm for recent issues, they are likely to sail through easily.   Nifty outlook  Nifty 50 index continues to trade in a tight consolidation range. Support and resistances are now placed at 15,600 and 15,900 levels. “Even though nifty has not broken the support, it is trading below the trendline drawn from April 2021 lows, which is also bearish. Traders are advised to maintain a neutral bias as long as Nifty does not break below 15,550. A break below the support is likely to trigger a short-term correction,” said Nirali Shah, Head of equity research, Samco Securities. "},

Investors and analysts are bearish on small-cap shares, which have been the best performers in the last five years.   The small-cap index, which rose as much as 0.7% to an all-time high of 15760.25 earlier in the day, ended 0.14% higher on Friday. The BSE  Sensex  ended marginally weak.   The rally in small-cap shares has lost steam in the last one month with the index losing 0.27% in the period. Analysts said investors are getting increasingly conscious about the growing gap in valuations between small-cap shares and blue chips.   “The valuation gap between largeand small-cap  stocks  has to narrow down for investors to consider them,“ said Vinod Nair, head of research, Geojit  Financial Services .   The S&P BSE Small Cap Index trades at a price to earnings ratio of 71.4 times, while the Sensex trades at 22.3 times. Historically, small-cap shares' valuations have been mostly lower than that of large cap shares. But, the rally in midand small-cap shares since September 2013 has changed this equation, with large cap valuations trading at a discount in this period. Analysts said activity in small-cap shares will continue to happen in pockets.   On Friday, shares of  Aban Offshore , Hin dustan  Oil Exploration Company  and  Deep Industries  in the oil exploration and production space rose between 3.5 per cent to 11.6 per cent on Friday on expectations that fall in crude prices will speed up rig deployments and hence payments to offshore companies. Information technology companies like  Aptech ,  Aurionpro Solutions ,  NIIT Technologies ,  Rolta  were up between 3 per cent and 8 per cent.   Analysts said the implementation of GST will play a role in tempering the valuations.   “GST has been largely neutral to higher-than-expected for the services sector and companies in this space will have to take price hikes. So we think valuations will take a hit for some of these expensively priced mid-cap companies,“ said Nair of Geojit.   The last time the small-cap index rose to its all-time high was a month ago, on May 17. While the Sensex and the BSE Midcap Index have risen 16.7 per cent and 22.06 per cent since the beginning of the year, the BSE Small Cap Index has outperformed, rising 28.53 per cent. In the last five years, the small-cap index has returned almost 30 per cent every year.   A recent note by UBS analysts Gautam Chhaochharia and Shaleen Kumar said that smalland mid-cap as an asset class have had a  sharp  run-up following  demonetisation , and valuation gap versus large caps is still high, even after a recent correction over the past month. “Over the past few months, we have downgraded some ratings, as we didn't find comfort at their valuations, despite being positive on their business models and longterm growth outlook.“ "},

These stocks can give 10 times return", "url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/wanna-take-a-daring-bet-these-stocks-can-give-10-times-return/articleshow/59435536.cms", "type": "News", "date": "04 Jul 2017, 10:32AM IST", "summary": "Even heavily debt-ridden firms try to restructure their businesses and get them on track.", "article": "NEW DELHI: Staying away from  stocks  of companies with huge debt on their balance sheets is prudence. Betting on them is daredevilry, but that often delivers big gains.   Even heavily debt-ridden firms do genuinely try to restructure their businesses and get them on track. And if you can see the intent at the right time, you are in for bonanza. Because such comeback stories always get rewarded generously.   For the past one month,  Jaiprakash Associates  appeared to be living such a story. The scrip rallied over 71 per cent in one month on conclusion of its Rs 16,189 crore deal with  UltraTech Cement  for selling six of its integrated cement plants and five grinding units.   Analysts said while retail investors may give debt-ridden stocks a miss, some of them might work like lottery if one can track the restructuring plan thoroughly.   “When companies go into a downtrend because of large debt, they default. If there are 100 such companies, 8-10 of them would give you that lottery when things turn around. They will grow share prices 8-10 times. But the question is, which ones (to bet on),” said Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, Partner, Rare Enterprises.   There are as many as nine BSE500 stocks, whose total debt is more than double their  market  values. Data showed  Videocon Industries  has around Rs 40,000 crore debt, which is 57 times its prevailing market-cap. The stock is down 80 per cent in last one year.      Latest available data pegged MTNL’s total debt at 14 times its prevailing market capitalisation. For  Aban Offshore , it is 13.35 times.  Rolta India ,  JBF Industries ,  Bajaj Hindustan ,  Unitech ,  Jindal Saw  are HCC have debt levels that are 2-7 times higher than their prevailing market values, data available with corporate database Capitaline showed.   Rajen Shah, Chief Investment Adviser at Tradebulls, said he is a ‘big fan’ of companies with huge debt, but with quality managements.   “In 2004, we had identified India Cement: the market cap was Rs 420 crore and debt was Rs 1,400 crore. What happened is history, because the stock went up from Rs 31 to Rs 300 in three years. A similar case was  Hotel Leela . When the hotel was setting up its Bangalore property, it had huge debt. It had only two properties; one in Mumbai, one in Goa, and there was huge debt because of the Bangalore property. The promoters took preferential  shares , reduced debt,” Shah said.   Subsequently, Hotel Leelaventure’s shares jumped from Rs 25 to Rs 200.   Among the debt-ridden stocks Rajen likes  Tata Power , which he believes can rally 70-80 per cent from current level.   “I personally own Tata Power. Rs 50,000 crore is the debt on its balance sheet and the market-cap is about Rs 21,000 crore. The management is serious about reducing debt. There were reports that they may sell out Mundra. If that happens, this stock is in for a big jump, and returns could be in excess of 50 per cent. Also, the management has very clearly laid out plans to sell some of its core assets and some investment. The investment value on Tata Power’s balance sheet is more than Rs 10,000 crore. They own about 6,500 shares of Tata Sons and they also own a 100 per cent subsidiary, Aftab Investment, which owns about 2,000 shares of Tata Sons. Both put together is worth about Rs 8,000-8,500 crore,” Rajen said.   “If you look at the other investment in group companies, it would be about Rs 2,000 crore or so. So basically, if they are able to do away with this Rs 10,000 crore investment, this can straightaway lead to a 40-45 per cent jump in market-cap. Along with this, if Mundra happens, I think the market cap of Tata Power, based on the calculations we have done at Tradebulls, can actually go 70-80 per cent higher,” he said. "},

Bank Nifty hogged the limelight even as the broader markets corrected. Sectorally, most pain was seen in the IT pack, which ended with a deep cut of over 3 per cent.  Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst, HDFC Securities, said after showing a consistent upmove in the last few sessions, Nifty witnessed an excellent upside recovery from the lows on Wednesday and closed the day lower by 66 points. Nifty opened with a sharp downside gap of 299 points on the backdrop of weak global cues and started with a smart upside recovery from the lows soon after the opening. Minor weakness was seen at the highs towards the end, and Nifty closed near the highs. The opening downside gap has been filled completely.  Siddhartha Khemka, Head - Retail Research,  Motilal Oswal Financial Services , maintained that Indian markets displayed strong resilience in the face of negative global cues. While markets opened 1.6% lower, they showed a steady recovery throughout the day to wipe out the entire opening loss and managed to close near day’s high with a marginal loss of 0.4%. Nifty reclaimed its 18,000 level, and we expect the momentum to continue in the near term towards 18,200.  That said, here’s a look at what some key indicators are suggesting for Thursday’s action:   US stocks post modest gains Wall Street 's main indexes were higher on Wednesday following a sharp selloff in the previous session after red-hot inflation data fanned worries about how much and how long the US Federal Reserve will hike interest rates.  The Dow Industrial Average added 106 points, or 0.3%. The S&P 500 gained 0.4%, and Nasdaq Composite ticked up about 0.4%. Markets are also pricing in a 37% chance of a massive 100 bps increase by the central bank, and expects rates to peak at 4.34% by March 2023.   European shares drop  European shares dipped on Wednesday after higher-than-expected US inflation cemented views of a large interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve next week, but a rally in retailers led by Spain's Inditex kept declines in check.  The continent-wide STOXX 600 index slipped 0.99%, with rate-sensitive technology stocks down 0.5%. The banks index in Europe edged 0.5% higher.   Tech View: A long bullish candle A long bullish candle formed on the daily chart with a minor upper shadow. Technically, this pattern indicates emergence of sharp buying interest from the lower support. After moving above the important resistance of the down sloping trend line at 17,900 levels recently, the Nifty witnessed sharp buying from near that trend line support as per the concept of change in polarity. This is a positive indication.   Stocks showing bullish bias Momentum indicator Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) showed a bullish trade setup on the counters of LT Foods, Kalyan Jewellers, Canara Bank, HDFC Bank,  Oriental Hotels ,  Sterlite Technologies  and  Orient Paper . The  MACD  is known for signalling trend reversals in traded securities or indices. When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement and vice versa.   Stocks signalling weakness ahead The MACD showed bearish signs on the counters of  Suzlon Energy ,  Jaiprakash Power ,  Hathway Cable , NLC India,  Crompton Greaves  and NCC, among others. A Bearish crossover on the MACD on these counters indicated that they haD just begun their downward journey.   Most active stocks in value terms Ambuja Cements  (Rs 2911 crore), Infosys (Rs 2,122 crore), Vedanta (Rs 1853 crore), TCS (Rs 1591 crore), and HDFC Bank (Rs 1536 crore) were among the most active stocks on NSE in value terms. Higher activity on a counter in value terms can help identify the counters with the highest trading turnovers in the day.   Most active stocks in volume terms YES Bank (Shares traded: 13.71 crore), Vodafone Idea(Shares traded: 12.43 crore), Zomato (Shares traded: 11.98 crore), Suzlon Energy (Shares traded: 9.81 crore), and Tata Steel (Shares traded: 8.64 crore) were among the most traded stocks in the session on NSE.   Stocks showing buying interest Shares of  Bajaj Holdings , Ambuja Cements, ITC, SBI,  Indian Hotels , and BoB witnessed strong buying interest from market participants as they scaled their fresh 52-week highs, signalling bullish sentiment.   Stocks seeing selling pressure Shares of  Piramal Enterprises ,  Alembic Pharma  and  Sanofi India  witnessed strong selling pressure and hit its new 52-week lows, signaling bearish sentiment on the counters.   Sentiment meter favours bulls Overall, market breadth favoured losers as 1,843 stocks ended with cuts, while 1,633 stocks advanced.

The conglomerate owned by Gautam Adani offered to buy 26% each from the public shareholders of the two cement companies after buying majority stakes in them from Holcim.  Out of the 4.9 crore ACC shares the Adani Group offered to buy from public shareholders, 40.61 lakh shares were tendered on the final day. In  Ambuja  Cement, 7.27 lakh shares were tendered which is 0.14% of the 51.64 crore shares Adani offered to buy. Shareholders refrained from tendering their shares in Ambuja because the open offer price was below the stock price. In the case of ACC, the offer price was at a modest premium to the stock price.  The group offered to buy 26% of  Ambuja Cements  for Rs 385 per share. Shares of Ambuja Cement declined 1.7% on Friday to close at Rs 453.90. ACC shares fell 2.28% to close at Rs 2365 on Friday. In the case of ACC, the offer price is Rs 2,300 per share.  Shareholders, who tendered their shares during the open offers, will get the payment latest by September 23, 2022.  As per the shares tendered, Adani Group will have to shell out a total of Rs 962 crore for the open offer corpus of Rs 31,140 crore it had set aside for the two companies.  Adani  Group’s holding in Ambuja Cement will increase to 63.24% from 63.2%. Its stake along with Ambuja Cement’s holding in ACC will rise to 56.69% from 54.53%.  Sebi  rules require acquirers to make a mandatory offer to buy at least 26% stake from public shareholders if they buy 25% or more in a listed company. The rule aims to give minority investors an exit option during the buyout.  If all shareholders of both the companies had tendered their holdings in the open offers, Adani's stake in Ambuja Cement would have increased to 89.2% and to 80.53% in ACC. As per Sebi’s minimum public shareholding norms, listed companies are required to bring the promoter’s shareholding down to 75% within twelve months of the open offer.  In May, Adani Group announced to buy both the companies from Holcim for a little over $10.5 billion. The deal was India’s largest-ever M&A transaction in the infrastructure and materials space.  For Ambuja Cements, Adani had made an open offer to its public shareholders to acquire up to 51.63 crore shares, representing 26% of the expanded share capital for Rs19,879.57 crore.  In the case of ACC, the group had offered to acquire up to 4.89 crore shares held by public shareholders, representing 26% of the expanded share capital for Rs 11,259.97 crore.  Upon completion of the deal, Adani Group is the second-largest cement maker in the country, with a combined pan India capacity of 66 million tonnes per annum (mtpa)."},

The S&P BSE Sensex closed with losses of more than 200 points but managed to hold on to 60,000 on a closing basis, which is a positive sign.

Here's what Rahul Goud, Research Analyst - Equity Research, CapitalVia Research, recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:   Fortis Healthcare: Buy Fortis Healthcare is an integrated healthcare delivery service provider, involved in creating and running hospitals, diagnostic facilities, and research facilities.  Given the increasing case mix in the hospital segment and attempts to reduce costs, we anticipate improved margins across all categories.  Technically, equities have shown a breakout from a tight range with volume, and the momentum indicator MACD also points to a bullish outlook for the stock.  Traders can purchase stock at the current market price of Rs 307 with a stop loss of Rs 296 and a short-term target price of Rs 325.   Allcargo Logistics: Buy  Offering integrated logistics solutions is what Allcargo Logistics does. Revenue has expanded at a yearly rate of 29.22 per cent for the past five years, compared to the industry average of 9.69 per cent, while the market share increased from 13.51 per cent to 27.82 per cent during that time.  Technically, the stock has been trading in a downward trend since January 2022, but on Wednesday, it broke out of that channel with strong volumes.  The stock can be bought at the current market price of Rs 438 with a stop loss of Rs 415 and a mid-term target price of Rs 500.   Ambuja Cements: Avoid On the back of a fund-raising scheme, Ambuja Cements witnessed strong buying action on Wednesday. On September 9, 2022, the open offer by the Adani family to buy a further 26% share in  ACC  and Ambuja Cements expired.  A 54.53 per cent stake in ACC is held by Ambuja Cements. Technically, the stock has risen too much and thus, we advise investors to avoid it at this time.   (Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

And we anticipate going from the current 70 million tonne capacity to 140 million tonne in next 5 years.", "article": "Days after completing a USD 6.5 billion acquisition of  Ambuja Cements  and  ACC , billionaire Gautam Adani said his group has planned to double cement manufacturing capacity and become the most profitable manufacturer in the country. He saw a multifold rise in cement demand in India on the back of record-breaking economic growth and the government's infrastructure creation push, which will give significant margin expansion.    In a speech made at an event to mark the completion of the acquisition on September 17, the Adani Group founder and chairman said the ports-to-energy conglomerate has in a single stroke become the second largest cement manufacturer in the country.    Adani Group last week completed buyout of Swiss major Holcim's stake in the two firms.    Calling the acquisition historic, he said this buyout is India's largest ever inbound M&A transaction in the infrastructure and materials space and closed in a record time of 4 months.    \"Our entry into this business is happening at a time when India is on the cusp of one of the greatest economic surges seen in the modern world,\" he said in the speech, which was released on Monday.    Stating reasons for the foray into the cement space, he said while India is the second largest producer of cement in the world, its per capita consumption is just 250 kg compared to 1,600 kg of China. \"This is almost a 7x headroom for growth.\"    Also, \"as several of the government's programmes gather momentum, the long-term average growth in cement demand is expected to be 1.2 to 1.5 times the GDP. We anticipate growing at twice this number,\" he said.    With trillion-dollar investment planned in infrastructure and housing in the country, cement is an attractive \"adjacency to our infrastructure business, especially the group's ports and logistics business, green energy business, and the e-commerce platform being developed,\" he said.    Adani Group's competency in driving operational efficiency will result in \"significant margin expansion to become the most profitable cement manufacturer in the country,\" he said. \"And we anticipate going from the current 70 million tonne capacity to 140 million tonne in next 5 years.\"    On his group's growth philosophy, Adani, 60, said it is the belief in India's growth story.    India will be a USD 25-30 trillion economy by 2050, which points to huge growth prospects, he said.    The group is the world's largest solar power company and has committed USD 70 billion investment in clean energy business including green hydrogen, he said.    Adani Group is the largest airport operator in the nation with 25 per cent of passenger traffic and 40 per cent of air cargo. It is the largest ports and logistics company in the country with a 30 per cent market share.    \"We are India's largest integrated energy player spanning generation, transmission, distribution, LNG, LPG, city gas and piped gas distribution.

Following the acquisition, both of the companies have changed their management and boards and have announced a change in the fiscal year to April-March from January-December.", "article": "Adani Group completed the acquisition of Holcim’s stake in  ACC  and  Ambuja Cements  last Friday and there was strong traction in both these stocks in Monday's trade. While ACC gained 4 per cent, Ambuja soared 11 per cent in intra-day deals. Nonetheless, foreign brokerage Morgan Stanley maintained its underweight rating on both the stocks in the backdrop of Rs 20,000 crore fund infusion plan.  As part of the Rs 20,000 crore fund infusion, the company shall be issuing convertible warrants (each to Harmonia Trade and Investment (a listed promoter of  Adani Green ) on a preferential basis at Rs 418.87 per warrant (19 per cent discount to the current market price and a 9 per cent premium to the open offer price).  The brokerage is of the view that there is still no clarity around the end-use. \"This will drive near-term volatility for the industry, but is net positive in the medium term,” it said.  Adani's stake in ACC now stands at 56.7 per cent while in Ambuja it is at 63.2 per cent. Following the acquisition, both of the companies have changed their management and boards and have announced a change in the fiscal year to April-March from January-December.  The foreign research house iterates that “ACC+ACEM have combined capacity of 68mtpa, which should move to 80mtpa by F24, assuming current expansion plans are on track. Deals over the past few years have materialized at an average of Rs 6,500/ton – assuming the same cost of setting up a new plant/deal value going forward; Rs 20,000 crore capital could drive 31mtpa additional capacity, taking ACC+ACEM's combined capacity to 111mtpa”.  That said, the entity is of the view that “commissioning of new capacity and normalization of utilization levels from new capacity takes time (overall 4-5 years), and hence there would be a limited impact on industry utilization rates in the medium term”.  As for the implications of the fund infusion plan, Morgan Stanley noted that the change in promoters and organic/inorganic expansion could pave the way for improved margins over time, led by various cost synergies and operating leverage opportunities. But we need to wait and see how that plays out, it added.  Over the next couple of years, however, ACC+ACEM's volume growth will lag larger peers given the high starting point of capacity utilization rates for them. Moreover, current cost structures for both ACC and ACEM will keep medium-term profitability in check”.  Morgan Stanley further added that ACC and Ambuja shares have outperformed peers YTD and current valuations are not cheap relative to peers, limiting any re-rating triggers and hence upside potential.  It maintained underweight ratings on both ACC and Ambuja.  Giving a holistic view of the sector as a whole and the impact of the recent Adani deal, Morgan Stanley is net positive on the industry in the medium term. The firm adds that unlike in the earlier upcycle of 2010, this time capacity addition is largely concentrated with larger players, which lowers the risk of unjustified capacity additions and thereby price wars.

Logistics cost of exports are very high in India. Nearly 14 per cent of the total value of goods goes into logistics cost, while in other major economies it is just 6-8 per cent of total value of goods, rendering Indian goods less competitive in the  global market .   Ace stock picker  Porinju Veliyath  in a tweet said, “Market cap of India's logistics sector is too small, long way to go!”   Infrastructure status will also help the sector access loans on easier terms and improve economic growth.   Cheering the development, most logistics players were trading in the green in morning trade on Tuesday.  Aegis Logistics  was up 0.54 per cent at Rs 234.55 around 9.50 am (IST), while  Sical Logistics  was up 2.94 per cent at Rs 227.95. Recently listed  Mahindra Logistics  was trading 2.13 per cent up at Rs 427 at around the same time.  Tiger Logistics  was up 2.58 per cent up at Rs 191.   “Infrastructure status will help the companies in these sectors to raise funds at competitive rates on long-term basis, which will in turn help in reducing logistics cost and boost external trade,” said Choice Broking.   Market experts are positive on a couple of logistics players at present. ICICIdirect.com believes  Gati  can touch Rs 155 in the coming months, whereas Kotak Secruties is positive on  VRL Logistics  with a target price of Rs 450. Gati was trading 2 per cent up at Rs 143.65 in morning trade. VRL was up 1.91 per cent at Rs 400.   Anshuman Magazine, chairman, India and South East Asia, CBRE said, “The granting of infrastructure status to the logistics sector will result in higher investments, which will drive the revolution of the segment in India. With India's growing  economy  and boost to the sector, increased movement is expected in the industrial and warehousing segment. Both cold chain and warehousing facilities are covered in the announcement and will go a long way in strengthening infrastructure development across India. Coupled with the implementation of the  GST , this will provide an impetus to the segment as a whole and will enhance our competitiveness in the global market.”   While commenting on Gati, ICICIdirect.com in a research report said, “Resolution of foreign currency convertible  bonds  (FCCB) issue led to dilution of promoter’s stake to the extent of 7.3 per cent. Post this, the revised promoter holding is now at 29.8 per cent. The resultant impact of the same could now lead Gati to bring in a strategic investor or partner, raise funds for future expansion or demerge its business into separate entities (like  TCI ). The strategy may lead to a multiple re-rating due to which the brokerage house maintains ‘Buy’ rating on the stock with a revised target price of Rs 155.”   “Combination of GST and now giving it an infrastructure status is going to be good for the industry. With GST coming in, we are going to see large format houses coming and these warehouses require a lot of capital and long term borrowing. Infrastructure status will provide that facility which will give a boost to large warehouses. Once large format warehouses come into the country, you will see the cost of logistics go down,” said Pirojshaw Sarkari, CEO,  Mahindra  Logistics in a chat with ETNow. "},

Narendra Modi ’s eight years in his South Block office are marked with reformist measures such as demonetisation, implementation of goods and services tax, Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code and Real Estate Regulation and Development Act, and works based on Jan Dhan-Aadhar-Mobile (JAM), corporate tax rate cut, etc. These reforms led to huge volatility but also helped some stocks reach new heights.

At the same time, there are 19 stocks that have plunged 50-90 per cent.   Below are eight of the biggest gainers of the last eight years, and let's see if they are still buying candidates:   Tanla Platforms| Gain since 2014: 18,823%| Consensus rating: Strong Buy If you have received SMSes from your banks, e-commerce platforms or delivery services ever—there is a very good chance that  Tanla Platforms  is enabling some of those communications. The company has gained prominence in the last eight years thanks to the rapid adoption of mobile and mobile-based apps. The stock is still a strong buy, according to analysts, with a target in the range of Rs 1,850.   Balaji Amines| Gain since 2014: 6244%| Consensus rating: Strong Buy The company makes chemicals, especially methylamines, ethylamines, derivatives of specialty chemicals and pharma excipients. The company is a big beneficiary of the closure of 30 per cent of amine producers in China. Analysts remain bullish on the stock with targets around Rs 4,110.    Minda Industries| Gain since 2014: 5229%| Consensus rating: Hold Minda Industries  has established itself as one-stop shop for switches, lights and horns among other automotive components. It has a list of marquee domestic and global clients. The stock is still popular among many analysts but the consensus rating is ‘hold’, with median targets around Rs 1,075.   Saregama  India| Gain since 2014: 5030%| Consensus rating: Hold The company is the oldest music label company in India. It lost prominence with the rise of digital music distribution, but recently it has risen to fame thanks to two initiatives: Caravan (which is a modern music player) and Yoodlee Films (which makes digital thematic films for the youth with revenue coming from licensing to the likes of Netflix and Zee5). The stock has a ‘hold’ recommendation and a consensus price target of Rs 480.    Navin Fluorine  International| Gain since 2014: 4714%| Consensus rating: Hold The company is a major manufacturer of refrigerants (the gas you see in refrigerators) and fluorides. The stock of the company has got a fillip from some multi-year deals it has signed with the likes of  Honeywell  International, giving investors revenue visibility. After a massive rally in the last eight years, most analysts have a ‘hold’ rating with target of around Rs 4,000.   KEI  Industries| Gain since 2014: 4414%| Consensus rating: Strong Buy The company presents itself as a “one-stop solutions provider” for wires and cables. It supplies cables to various sectors like power, oil refineries, railways, etc. HSBC,  Infosys  are some of its major customers. The stock remains a ‘strong buy’ among analysts with a target at Rs 1,315.   Tasty Bite  Eatables| Gain since 2014: 4068%| Consensus rating: None The company is a manufacturer of ethnic and natural vegetarian packaged and ready to eat (RTE) food products.

But now, skepticism has started to cloud that view.  The near-term outlook for the sector has changed drastically, says some experts.

This was exacerbated by clogged supply routes. Supply chain issues have eased out to some extent now, along with the demand-supply dynamics. Prices of most of the chemicals have either started to correct or are steady.  A price check by Emkay Global at the end of November showed month-on-month prices of widely used chemicals such as acetic acid, ethylene glycol, acetone, caprolactam, phenol, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, propylene and ethyl acetate have fallen up to 16 per cent. Quarter-on-quarter prices of benzene, methylene diphenyl diisocyanate, vinyl acetate monomer and poly-vinyl chlorine have fallen 10-20 per cent.     As most deals are signed at the prevailing prices, the best course of action for chemical companies would have been to deliver the products at those prices. But most manufacturers are refraining from price commitment, and are keen on volumes with variable pricing, says an analyst tracking the sector.  “This is to enable them with some flexibility in these volatile times as increasing power, fuel and logistics costs have led to higher overheads,” says analysts with Mumbai-based B&K Securities. But this flexibility will definitely come at the cost of margins.  Among the most hit by the price fluctuations have been those making commodity chemicals, especially active pharmaceutical ingredients (API), to supply to pharma companies. Speciality chemical makers are relatively safer as their use cases are very niche, which will keep the demand intact.   “One sector that I will book profit in is chemicals because a) valuations are demanding and, b) there are concerns on near term earnings growth,” Srinivas Rao Ravuri, Chief Investment Officer at PGIM India Mutual Fund, said during a recent interaction with ETMarkets.  However, not every chemical company is at a disadvantage. Analysts are bullish on those supplying to and from the paint industry — a lucrative deal as demand for paints has gone up, given the economy has picked up.   “The underlying demand for decorative paints/adhesive continues to be strong and ahead of our expectations,” says Jaykumar Doshi of Kotak Securities. “We raise our earnings estimates for decorative paints players by 3-14 per cent and that for Pidilite by 2-4 per cent.” "},

Nifty ended the day with a loss of 42 points while the Sensex lost 153 points to end at 52,693.57.  Here's how analysts read the market pulse:  The daily RSI is in a bearish crossover. The trend is likely to remain sideward in the short term. On the lower end, support is visible at 15,650. On the higher end, resistance is placed at 15,900/16,000,” said Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at  LKP Securities .  Ajit Mishra, VP - Research, Religare Broking, said traders must limit leveraged positions ahead of the US Fed meet outcome tomorrow night.  That said, here’s a look at what some key indicators are suggesting for Thursday’s action:   Wall Street  gives up earlier bounce  Wall Street is wobbling Tuesday in its first trading after tumbling into a bear market on worries that high inflation will push central banks to clamp the brakes too hard on the economy.  The S&P 500 was 0.2% lower in midday trading as investors brace for the Federal Reserve's announcement on Wednesday about what it will do with interest rates. It was an unsteady move, though, and the index swung between an earlier loss of 0.5% and gain of 0.8% after a couple big companies flexed financial strength with stronger profits and payouts to shareholders.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 109 points, or 0.4%, at 30,407, as of 11:09 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.1% lower after swinging between a gain of 0.9% and a loss of 0.4%.   European stocks hover near March 2021 low  European stocks traded near their lowest level since March 2021 as investors remained worried about aggressive central-bank policy tightening amid stubbornly high inflation.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index was down 0.9% as of 2:44 p.m. in London, its sixth straight day of losses. Retail and construction sectors led declines, while banks and energy outperformed.   Tech View: Support at 15,600-700  Nifty50  formed an 'Inverted Hammer' candle on the daily chart, which at many times is formed around bottoms, as traders remain sceptical about the initial pullback attempts, said analysts. Analysts said the level of 15,600-700 remains strong support for the index going ahead. They see resistance at the 16,850 level.   Stocks showing bullish bias  Momentum indicator Moving Average Convergence Divergence ( MACD ) showed a bullish trade setup on the counters of  Alkyl Amines ,  Dalmia Bharat ,  Bharti Airtel , Siemens, and  Avanti Feeds .  The MACD is known for signaling trend reversals in traded securities or indices. When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement and vice versa.   Stocks signalling weakness ahead  The MACD showed bearish signs on the counters of Birlasoft, ITI Ltd,  Adani Ports  & SEZ, NOCIL,  Essel Propack  and  Century Textiles . A bearish crossover on the MACD on these counters indicated that they had just begun their downward journey.   Most active stocks in value terms  Reliance Industries  (Rs 1,791 crore),  Bajaj Finance  (Rs 1,014 crore), ICICI Bank (Rs 918 crore), Infosys (Rs 875 crore), TCS (Rs 840 crore), and  Tata Motors  (Rs 795.86 crore) were among the most active stocks on NSE in value terms. Higher activity on a counter in value terms can help identify the counters with the highest trading turnovers in the day.   Most active stocks in volume terms  Tata Motors (Shares traded: 1.9 crore), NTPC (Shares traded: 1.7 crore), ICICI Bank (Shares traded: 1.3 crore), ONGC (Shares traded: 1.2 crore), Power Grid (Shares traded: 1.2 crore) and SBI (Shares traded: 1.1 crore) were among the most traded stocks in the session on NSE.   Stocks showing buying interest  Shares of  Varun Beverages  witnessed strong buying interest from market participants as they scaled their fresh 52-week highs, signalling bullish sentiment.   Stocks seeing selling pressure  Hindalco,  Tech Mahindra , BPCL,  Asian Paints ,  Bajaj Finserv , Wipro and Bajaj Finance witnessed strong selling pressure and hit their 52-week lows, signalling bearish sentiment on the counters.   Sentiment meter favours bears  Overall, market breadth favoured losers as 1,435 stocks ended in the green, while 1,874 names settled with cuts.

While shares of Aarti Industries,  Alkyl Amines , and Deepak Nitrite have declined 28% each since January 1, Clean Science and Fine Organics plunged 34% and 39%, respectively, during this period.   Analysts said the April-June results are unlikely to provide respite to these companies, but their share valuations have turned attractive.  We believe the recent 15-25% correction in speciality chemicals' stocks offers an opportunity to accumulate them,\" said Rohan Gupta, analyst,  Edelweiss  Securities. \"SRF on refrigerant gases and fluoropolymers players like Gujarat Fluorochemicals will continue to reap the benefit of a strong pricing environment in FY23. Aarti Industries and Deepak Nitrite may have to contend with some volatility due to large capex commissioning.  Analysts said demand from FMCG, textiles, and autos may shrink due to elevated prices. They said demand remains firm from agrochemicals, fluoropolymers, and pharma. Companies like  Navin Fluorine  and SRF have high exposure to agrochemicals and pharma sectors. \"For chemical companies, where the end-user industries are non-agrochemicals and pharma, there could be demand challenges due to overall high inflationary environment globally and continued supply-chain pressures,\" said Abhishek Navalgund, analyst, Nirmal Bang Equities. \"Demand pressure would further restrict the ability of select companies to pass on the cost impact to clients entirely.  Though we maintain a positive view on the sector in the long-term, we may see some downgrade in earnings and moderation in valuation in the near term.

Bank  shares  dragged the Nifty and the  Sensex  by more than half-a-per cent inThursday's session after Wednesday's RBI policy announcement. While market sentiment seems to have turned a bit depressed, analysts see no sign that the broader market will come crashing down in a hurry. For Friday, the market does not have much of positive trigger to bounce back, but any major correction is also unlikely.   The Nifty50 futures on the Singapore Stock Exchange were trading slightly lower at 10,034 early this morning, indicating a flat opening for the domestic market.   On Thursday, the Nifty50 formed a 'Bearish Belt Hold' pattern for the second consecutive day. Though corrections since the June lows have not lasted beyond two days, the index needs to hold above the 9,985 level to avoid any weakness in the ongoing trend. The index has broken the 11-day ascending channel with multiple touch points on the lower timeframe charts.   Asian  markets  traded mixed this morning. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was trading marginally higher, with many investors reluctant to stake out fresh positions ahead of US job data due later in the day. Japan's Nikkei dropped 0.4 per cent on a stronger yen, and looked set to end the week little changed.

The domestic currency opened at 63.65 to the dollar against Wednesday's close at 63.70 to the dollar, a level last seen on July 22, 2015.  In other news, the Rs 1,468 crore initial public offering of Cochin Shipyard ended on a strong note on Thursday, with the issue being subscribed 76.1 times. The offer received bids for 258.69 crore shares compared with 3.39 crore shares on offer.   Watch out the  Videocon  counter in Friday's trade as an SBI-led consortium of lenders has ordered a forensic  audit  of the company's accounts to find out whether it foundered because of adverse business conditions or financial mismanagement. The move is preliminary to start of debt restructuring after Videocon defaulted on loans worth Rs 43,000 crore, they said.

Lastly, a quick look at some of the interesting headlines from the print edition of ETMarkets.   An investment of Rs 1 lakh in  RIL  shares six month ago would now be worth Rs 1.59 lakh. A similar investment in the Nifty it would only have fetched Rs 1.14 lakh. The ongoing rally in RIL after the underperformance of the past eight years helped the Nifty scale record highs as it contributed nearly 16% of the total index gains since the beginning of the year. RIL's stock is the largest gainer on the Nifty in the past six months.   Warren Buffett's bet on  Apple  gained $1 billion on Wednesday. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway owns about 135 million shares of Apple. Apple released its third quarter earnings report after the bell on Tuesday and beat Wall Street's expectations. Shares of the company rose 5.11% on Wednesday.   The projected next-fiscal earnings for  JK Tyre , Apollo Tyres, MRF and  CEAT  could see an upgrade between 5% and 15% if India imposes anti-dumping duties on truck and bus radial tyres. The Directorate General of Antidumping and Allied Duties, a watchdog overseeing unfair trade practices, has recommended imposing 7-12% anti-dumping duties on TBR used in the commercial transportation sector. The Ministry of Finance is yet to decide on the recommendations of DGAD.   We would leave you with that much for now.

Nifty consolidated within a range and ended the day below 15,800.  Here's how analysts read the market pulse:  Ruchit Jain, Lead Research,  5paisa.com , said that post the recent pullback move, many key indices such as Nifty, Bank Nifty, Nifty IT, Midcap100 and Smallcap are trading around their respective 20-day EMAs. “A closing above this average is required for a continuation of the positive momentum, and until then, the risk remains high for fresh longs, and hence one should be light on positions,” he said.  Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst, HDFC Securities, said after the formation of a false upside breakout at 15,800 levels on 27th June, the absence of any sharp weakness from near the hurdle in the last three sessions could be in favour of bulls to make a comeback from the lows. “But, any decisive move below 15,600 levels is likely to negate the bullish bet and could result in sharp weakness down to 15,200 levels.”  That said, here’s a look at what some key indicators are suggesting for Friday’s action:   S&P 500 set for worst first-half since 1970 US stocks tumbled on Thursday, setting the S&P 500 for its worst first six months since 1970, on concerns that central banks determined to tame inflation will hamper global economic growth.  Fears over slowing growth and surging prices have rippled through markets, with recession worries taking center stage as monetary policymakers across the world look to aggressively raise borrowing costs.

European shares face worst quarter since early 2020 European shares on Thursday looked set for their worst quarter since the pandemic-led carnage in early 2020, as investors became increasingly wary of a global recession in the wake of hawkish central bank actions to tame rapid inflation.  The continent-wide STOXX 600 index dropped 1.3%, setting it up for quarterly losses of more than 10%.  France's CAC 40 index slid 1.8% as preliminary official figures showed inflation climbed further from the previous month to a record 6.5%.   Tech View: Nifty forms Doji candle  Nifty50  formed a Long-legged Doji on the daily chart. Such a candle suggests indecisiveness among traders. Analysts said the index needs to move out of the 15,600-900 range for a directional move.

However, intermittent volatility may not be ruled out due to adverse global cues.That said, here’s a look at what some key indicators are suggesting for Friday’s action", "article": "Indian shares continued their losing-run for a second session on Thursday as fears of a large Fed rate hike dampened sentiments across markets. The Nifty ended below the 18,000 mark while Bank Nifty, which outperformed in the previous session, witnessed some profit-booking and ended with cuts.  Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst, HDFC Securities, said, “After showing a sharp upside bounce from the intraday lows on Wednesday, Nifty slipped into weakness amidst volatility and closed the day lower by 126 points. After opening with a positive note, the market failed to sustain the gains at the hurdle of 18,100 levels and turned weak in the early-mid part of the session. Intraday volatility was seen on the day of weekly F&O expiry, and the market closed near the lows”.  Siddhartha Khemka, Head - Retail Research,  Motilal Oswal Financial Services , believes the markets are becoming nervous around the 18K mark and are unable to sustain gains made on Wednesday. Nifty needs to sustain above 17,700-17,800 zones for the overall setup to remain positive. We expect the market to remain in consolidation mode for the next few days until the US Fed rate action is over. However, intermittent volatility may not be ruled out due to adverse global cues.  That said, here’s a look at what some key indicators are suggesting for Friday’s action:   US stocks edge higher after data Wall Street  stocks edged up early Thursday following mixed economic data as markets largely shrugged off the apparent aversion of a major freight rail strike.  About 25 minutes into trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.3 percent at 31,212.31.  The broad-based S&P 500 edged up 0.1 percent to 3,948.62, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index added less than 0.1 percent at 11,723.71.   European stocks fend off rate risks European markets were choppy on Thursday, while banking stocks maintained strong gains. The pan-European Stoxx 600 fell 0.72% mid-afternoon in London, after flipping between mild losses and gains during the morning.   Tech View: Long negative candle A long negative candle on the daily chart engulfed Wednesday's long bull candle. Technically, this market action signals the emergence of selling pressure at the resistance of 18,100 levels. The Nifty is expected to find support around 17,750-17,700 in the short term.   Stocks showing bullish bias Momentum indicator Moving Average Convergence Divergence ( MACD ) showed a bullish trade setup on the counters of  Power Grid , IDBI Bank,  Aditya Birla Capital , and  Delta Corp , among others.  The MACD is known for signalling trend reversals in traded securities or indices. When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement and vice versa.   Stocks signalling weakness ahead The MACD showed bearish signs on the counters of HUDCO, NBCC, TVS Motor,  Texmaco Rail  and Cipla, among others. A bearish crossover on MACD on these counters indicated that they had just begun their downward journey.   Most active stocks in value terms  Vedanta (Rs 2282 crore),  Ambuja Cements  (Rs 1997 crore), Infosys (Rs 1,844 crore),  Adani Enterprises  (Rs 1735 crore) and  ICICI Bank  (Rs 1500 crore) were among the most active stocks on NSE in value terms. Higher activity on a counter in value terms can help identify the counters with the highest trading turnovers in the day.   Most active stocks in volume terms JP Power (Shares traded: 10,71 crore),  IDFC First Bank  (Shares traded: 9.14 crore), Zomato (Shares traded: 8.81 crore), YES Bank (Shares traded: 8.15 crore) and  Vodafone Idea  (Shares traded: 7.81 crore) were among the most traded stocks in the session on NSE.   Stocks showing buying interest Shares of Ceat,  Welspun Corp , MRF,  Shoppers Stop , Apollo Tyre, and Kalyan Jewellers were among stocks that witnessed strong buying interest from market participants as they scaled their fresh 52-week highs, signalling bullish sentiment.   Stocks seeing selling pressure Shares of  Piramal Enterprises ,  Alembic Pharma  and  Sanofi India  witnessed strong selling pressure and hit its new 52-week lows, signaling bearish sentiment on the counters.   Sentiment meter favours bulls Overall, market breadth favoured losers as 1,859 stocks ended in the red, while 1,639 stocks advanced.

The Adani Group has been expanding aggressively into sectors as diverse as renewable energy, metals and cement, with a bulk of it being funded through debt.   The expansion has resulted in a meteoric rise in the stock prices of listed Adani Group companies, catapulting chairman  Gautam Adani  to the list of the richest people on the planet.  For the acquisition of Ambuja Cements and its subsidiary ACC, Adani raised $4.50 billion (₹35,879 crore) from 14 international banks, the company said in a statement. The acquisition has made the Adani Group the second-largest cement maker in the country, just behind Aditya Birla Group's  UltraTech Cement .  Following the acquisition, the conglomerate on Friday also announced the infusion of ₹20,000 crore in Ambuja Cements, hinting at the group's aggressive plan to enhance capacity through de-bottlenecking, greenfield facilities and acquisition.  Group chairman Adani stated on Monday that he plans to take the cement makers' combined manufacturing capacity to 140 million tonnes per annum by 2030 from 70 million tonnes at present. "},

March quarter  LPG  volumes improved for this logistics firm materially, the foreign brokerage said in its latest note, adding that the commissioning of 4 million tonne per annum Kandla LPG terminal will drive volume growth in FY23.  The brokerage has maintained a 'Buy' on the stock with a target of Rs 425, suggesting a 100 per cent potential upside. The scrip closed at Rs 213.35 on Wednesday.  Aegis is a play on liquids and LPG (gas) logistics. Its growth in the LPG business is driven by growth in LPG imports into India, as domestic production remains weak while consumption rises with an increased need for clean cooking fuel and increased affluence, Nomura said.  The company's liquid division, which includes third party liquid logistics and operations and maintenance services, accounted for about 33 per cent of Ebitda in the March quarter. Gas division accounted for the remaining 67 per cent Ebitda. This segment includes auto gas retailing, industrial gas distribution and gas sourcing.  The company has recently gained new capabilities with its JV with Vopak, which enables the company to increase the products it can handle across liquids and even new gases like ammonia and butadiene, Nomura India said.  Nomura said  Aegis  commissioned the Kandla LPG terminal in May, which finally cleared the path for closure of the Vopak deal, albeit with a two-month delay.  The Kandla terminal not only is a key volume driver in the near term -- Nomura estimates 0.5-0.7 million tonne logistics volume in FY23 --, but can also drive up distribution volumes by 10kt in FY23.  We expect a string of growth project announcements in industrial terminals, new products and further capacity expansions in the following months. Of note, Aegis has already decided to progress with five projects under the JV with planned capex of Rs 1,250 crore . We believe the Aegis Vopak JV benefits are not well understood by investors at present,\" it said.  Nomura said Aegis distribution sales have already crossed 50 kt in March quarter, and a further uptick from the normalisation of auto gas sales to pre-pandemic levels, and  contribution from the addition of five more LPG bottling plants may achieve a quarterly volume rate of over 40kt.  Profitability of the distribution segment at Rs 5,000-10,000 per tonne is almost 5-10 times higher than gas logistics. Furthermore, the acquisition of 0.5mntpa of liquids capacity in Kandla will also support strong liquids volume growth, it said.  The company reported a 46 per cent YoY rise in net profit at Rs 102 crore for the March quarter. Revenues jumped 108 per cent YoY to Rs 2,104 crore. While gas division Ebitda grew 22 per cent YoY to Rs 111 crore the normalised liquid division Ebidata was flattish at Rs 54 crore.

The Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) Monetary Policy Committee is set to meet between June 6-8, with the announcement on Wednesday morning. Market believes that rate hike is a no-brainer considering the rising inflation in the country. The Reserve Bank is expected to go for another rate hike of 0.40 per cent at the scheduled review of the monetary policy next week, said global brokerage firm BofA Securities.   In a surprise on May 4, RBI had hiked rates by 40 basis points. Other than these, rising prices of crude oil and strengthening dollar are likely to have a double whammy on the domestic economy, amid the rising inflationary worries and looming recession fears. On the other hand, the constant selling from foreign investors is also an ominous sign for the equity markets. FPIs have been selling for the straight eight months now and have pulled out about Rs 1.7 lakh crore in the year 2022 so far.   "},

Apart from IT, all other sectors ended in the green. Metals, oil & gas, auto and PSU banks were top sectoral gainers.  Here's how analysts read the market pulse:  Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst, HDFC Securities, said the short term uptrend status of Nifty remains intact, and the market is taking a temporary halt before showing further up move in the near term. “Hence, the current range movement within 16,100-16,250 levels is likely to extend for the next session. A sustainable move above 16,300 could be viewed as strengthening of upside momentum,” he said.  Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at  LKP Securities , said the benchmark Nifty remained sideways during the session. “On the daily timeframe, the index has sustained above its near-term moving average. The momentum oscillator RSI maintains its bullish crossover. The short-term trend is likely to remain positive as long as it holds above 16,000. On the higher end, resistance is visible at 16,300.  That said, here’s a look at what some key indicators are suggesting for Tuesday’s action:   US stocks retreat ahead of earnings season  Stocks fell in morning trading on  Wall Street  Monday as markets turned cautious ahead of earnings reports from big U.S. companies and updates on how badly inflation is hitting American businesses and households.  The S&P 500 fell 1.3% as of 10:21 a.m. Eastern. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 203 points, or 0.7%, to 31,134 and the Nasdaq fell 2.2%.  Twitter fell 6.7% after Elon Musk announced late Friday that he would abandon his $44 billion offer to buy the social media company, while Twitter said it would sue the billionaire to enforce his commitment to the purchase.   European shares European markets fell as the shutdown of a major gas pipeline from Russia to Germany for annual maintenance brought concern Russia might not resume the flow of gas as scheduled.  The pan-European Stoxx 600 index opened 1.03% lower with all sectors in negative territory apart from healthcare stocks.   Tech View: Small bullish candle on daily chart Nifty50  ended up forming a small bullish candle on the daily chart, with small wicks. Analysts said the momentum stays positive as long as the 50-pack index holds above the 16,000-16,100 range. Upside hurdle is at around 16,300 level, they said.   Stocks showing bullish bias Momentum indicator Moving Average Convergence Divergence ( MACD ) showed a bullish trade setup on the counters of Blue Star,  Borosil Renewables ,  Aegis Logistics , Cyient,  Shilpa Medicare  and  Suven Pharma .  The MACD is known for signalling trend reversals in traded securities or indices. When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement and vice versa.   Stocks signalling weakness ahead The MACD showed bearish signs on the counters of  GMM Pfaudler ,  Gland Pharma , Birlasoft and TCS. A bearish crossover on the MACD on these counters indicated that they had just begun their downward journey.   Most active stocks in value terms TCS (Rs 2,183 crore), RIL (Rs 1,534 crore), Tata Steel (Rs 1,364 crore),  Bharti Airtel  (Rs 1,240 crore), Axis Bank (Rs 1,004 crore), and  ICICI Bank  (Rs 951 crore) were among the most active stocks on NSE in value terms. Higher activity on a counter in value terms can help identify the counters with the highest trading turnovers in the day.   Most active stocks in volume terms ONGC (Shares traded: 3.2 crore), Bharti Airtel (Shares traded: 1.9 crore), NTPC (Shares traded: 1.7 crore), Tata Steel (Shares traded: 1.5 crore), Axis Bank (Shares traded: 1.5 crore) and Hindalco (Shares traded: 1.4 crore) were among the most traded stocks in the session on NSE.   Stocks showing buying interest Shares of Adani Gas,  Gujarat Fluorochem ,  Sumitomo Chemical ,  Eicher Motors ,  Phoenix Mills ,  Tube Investments  and  Coromandel International  witnessed strong buying interest from market participants as they scaled their fresh 52-week highs, signalling bullish sentiment.   Stocks seeing selling pressure Shares of HCL Tech and Gland Pharma witnessed strong selling pressure and hit their 52-week lows, signalling bearish sentiment on the counters.   Sentiment meter favours bulls Overall, market breadth favoured winners as 2,055 stocks ended in the green, while 1,377 names settled with cuts.

The key takeaway from the conference was that there is an increased focus on cost-cutting and movement from batch to continuous process that helps reduce space requirement as well as OPEX drastically through a decline in usage of utilities and waste reduction.  Broadly, chemical companies follow two strategies: a)product and b)process.  Under the product strategy, the focus is on product development rather than on cost control or effective process technology.  At times, product may not have a ready market – the companies may have to approach consumers and demonstrate the effectiveness of their products towards whatever purposes they are intended for.  They safeguard knowledge about their products through in-house development/patents/ use of excipients/ lesser attrition.  A few examples are  Fine Organics ,  Galaxy Surfactants , Sudarshan Chemicals,  NOCIL , and Aether Industries.  Under the process strategy, the focus is on process optimization and continuous cost cutting on existing products. Attributes required are engineering skills and co-operation between R&D and production teams.  A few examples of such companies are Eternis,  Jayant Agro ,  UPL , and Laxmi Organics. The gap between India and the West in terms of knowledge has narrowed significantly.  India has vast resources in terms of chemistry and chemical engineers. However, the risk-taking capabilities are not high.  Since technology development requires high risk appetite, most of the domestic companies have so far not ventured into that direction.  Capex  is a key theme across board. Fine Organics is looking for a land in Gujarat for the next phase of expansion; their existing capacities would run out soon (by Mar’23). Aether Industries is planning a capex of INR4.5b.  I G Petrochemicals  is expanding its Phthalic and Maleic Anhydride capacities.  Vishnu Chemicals  is increasing its capacity for a capex of INR1.8-2.0b.  Rossari Biotech  expects to add more modules at Dahej.  Alkyl Amines  is expanding its amine capacity. Yasho is more than doubling its capacity while Ami is adding a new line for electrolytes.  Import substitution theme is driving the product development across companies. Aether is expanding its current basket of 16 products primarily based on import substitution.  I G Petrochemicals’ expansion also takes into account the huge import substitution of Phthalic and Maleic Anhydrides. Vishnu’s expansion is also based on domestic demand-supply gap.  Further, the past few quarters have witnessed unseen volatility in freight and raw material costs. As a result, several suppliers have enforced force majeure.  However, companies such as Fine Organics battled the uncertainties and even serviced the consumers who were facing issues with other suppliers.  These would further help Indian companies establish themselves as reliable suppliers and take advantage of the China+1 strategy.   We prefer  Vinati Organics , Nocil, and Galaxy Surfactants in this space with 12-month target: Vinati Organics: Buy| LTP RS 2191| Target Rs 2680| Upside 22%   Veeral Organics Pvt. Ltd. (wholly owned subsidiary of VO) is also set to commence production of MEHQ, Guaiacol and Iso Amylene in 1HFY24E, which should propel VO into the next level of its growth story.  Veeral Additives will commence production of AOs from Butyl Phenol, thus resulting in forward integration.   NOCIL: Buy| LTP Rs 260| Target Rs 319| Upside 22%   Debottlenecking of its existing units is expected in the near term, even as NOCIL evaluates its plans for the next three-to-five years. Domestic Tyre companies are planning to ramp up production, with a planned capex of INR200b over the next three years.  Galaxy Surfactants: Buy| LTP Rs 3253| Target Rs 4000| Upside 22%   Capex guidance was at INR1.5b each for FY23/FY24, similar to that in FY22. Expansion of products is expected to be across the board, but the focus will mainly be on Specialty Care Products.

Short-term traders might be having the best of both worlds, but long-term investors have become restless.  However, experts believe that equity investment remains the best asset class for investors in the longer term. Even data suggests the same.  At a time when returns from fixed deposits have remained muted and gold has just more than doubled investors' wealth, BSE barometer Sensex has delivered a return of 242 per cent since August 2012.  The stock-specific performance is more encouraging. Out of 340 stocks, which continued to be a part of the BSE500 index for over 10 years, 210 have outperformed the benchmark. Meanwhile, 85 of them have delivered a return of 1,000 per cent or even more.  The list is topped by  Alkyl Amines Chemicals  which has delivered an astronomical return of 13,345 per cent as the stock price jumped to Rs 2967.2 on August 30, 2022, from Rs 22.07 on August 31, 2012.  It is followed by  Tanla Platforms  which zoomed more than 13,000 per cent in the last one decade. The stock price jumped to Rs 719.55 from merely Rs 5.48.  Both these stocks have turned an investment of Rs 10,000 into more than Rs 13 lakh in 10 years, showing the power of compounding over the years.  Equity market is highly liquid and requires less capital compared to other asset classes which may lack both of the benefits. Equity space in India is the most tax effective asset class for the investors, compared to others,\" Sonal Minhas, Founder, Prescient Capital, said.  Companies like  Deepak Nitrite ,  Caplin Point Laboratories  and HLE Glascoat have also gained between 10,000-12,000 per cent, turning an investment of Rs 10,000 into at least Rs 10 lakh or more.   ETMarkets.com  Satyajeet Kunjeer, Founder & CEO, Deciml believe that young investors, who are starting their investment journey and have a lot of time ahead of them, should invest with a long-term view.  In the long term, equities have the best return generating potential compared to other asset classes,\" Kunjeer suggested. \"However, one should diversify their investments and have some exposure to other asset classes as well.  UNO Minda,  KEI Industries ,  Tata Elxsi ,  Balaji Amines ,  Navin Fluorine International ,  Bajaj Finance , SRF,  Garware Technical Fibres , Astral,  APL Apollo Tubes  and  Westlife Development  have gained between 5,000-10,000 per cent in the last one decade.   ET CONTRIBUTORS   ETMarkets.com  Market experts suggest that investors should focus on companies with strong business models, robust balance sheets, and solid growth prospects. One should look for  sturdy  moats to hunt wealth creators in the longer run.  Anubhav Mukherjee, Co-founder of Prescient Capital auto ancillaries focused on developing and supplying components to the EV industry, and engineering and capital goods companies that derive a significant portion of their revenue from global markets.  Equity is a long-term only investment and one should invest in this space for at least five years to ride the short-term volatility, said the founders of Prescient Capital. \"Even the fundamentals do not play out well in this short-time horizon.  In the longer run, stock performance is guided purely by the business performance, management's commitment and sound balance sheet, experts said.  Even the listed bluechips have reached their current stellar heights over the years but have seen sharp corrections in the near term.  Most investors believe equity is a short-term investment and one can get rich quickly by betting on equities in the short run, but the truth is exactly the opposite, said Minhas. \"One should use equity to compound wealth over long periods of time.

Over the past two quarters, Brent crude has almost doubled amid the Russia-Ukraine crisis.  Competitive intensity has increased with the market leader adopting an aggressive pricing strategy in select segments, which has made it difficult ... to recover the raw material price inflation,\" Kotak said in a note. \"We believe escalating raw material prices along with subdued demand in the replacement segment will continue to pressure profitability.  Tyre stocks  such as  Balkrishna Industries ,  MRF , and  Apollo Tyres  have corrected over 25% from their yearly highs, and  CEAT  and JK Tyres fell nearly 37%.  Kotak has cut  target prices  for Apollo, CEAT, and MRF. The decision is driven by a cut in Ebitda margin assumptions due to a further increase in the raw material basket and inadequate price hikes due to elevated competitive intensity and finance cost assumptions as interest rates head north.  Synthetic rubber, carbon black, and chemicals for which prices are derived from crude form around 40% of the raw material basket. Kotak expects global natural rubber (NR) inventory to decline soon, resulting in higher prices. NR accounts for around 38% of the raw material cost of domestic tyre companies. A 10% increase in NR prices would require a 2% price hike by the tyre companies. The firm has projected post-tax return ratios for CEAT, MRF and Apollo to remain below 10% in FY24.  "},

The session saw the index heading nowhere and trading in a directionless manner and in a much tentative mode.   Tuesday will once again see a modest opening, but we expect the market to trade in a range bound manner with positive bias. It would be critical to see that the  Nifty  continues to maintain itself above the 50-DMA mark.      Tuesday will see the levels of 10,030 and 10,055 playing out as immediate resistance levels. The levels of 9,945 and 9,910 will act as support area for the markets.   The  Relative Strength Index  – RSI on the Daily Chart is 54.2643 and it continues to stay neutral trading above its signal line.   The Daily MACD is still bearish, while it trades below its signal line. However, it is moving sharply towards reporting a positive crossover. In event of no downsides, we may see this indicator reporting a positive crossover.   On the candles, a Doji star has occurred, since it has gapped above the previous candle. This may potentially keep the markets momentarily subdued. However, this requires confirmation on the following day.  Pattern analysis shows that the Nifty has so far managed to keep its head above 50-DMA. Also, it trades slightly in the upward rising trend line and therefore is inside the upward rising channel.   However, given the rising nature of the trend line, this critical level of support/resistance too is rising higher each day. Therefore, it is imperative and extremely important for the markets to move up from current levels to go back comfortably into the upward rising channel.   All in all, the tentative nature of the Monday’s session may remain a slight worry. As of now, as evident from the F&O data, the under current remains buoyant and we may expect the markets to continue with its up move after a brief deliberation.   However, in the process, sustenance of the Nifty above 50-DMA will continue to remain of critical importance. Cautiously positive stock specific approach is advised for the day.   STOCKS  TO WATCH |  Fresh longs were observed in stocks like  Tata Power ,  Tata Steel ,  BHEL ,  Axis Bank  and  Coal India . Good technical setup is observed in stocks like Divi’s Labs,  Jagran Prakashan ,  TCS ,  Aban Offshore  and Brigade. We may see these counters trading with positive bias.

But don’t jump the gun; you may be treading a minefield.   Book value of a company is the worth of its assets carried on balance sheet. It is calculated by subtracting the accumulated depreciation from the cost of the asset.   Book value is also the  net asset value  of a company, which is worth the total assets minus the intangible assets (goodwill, patents) and liabilities.   If the price-to-book value (P/B) of a stock is ‘3x’, it means an investor is paying three times the book value to buy that stock.   On BSE, several otherwise popular stocks are currently trading at price-to-book value ratios below 1, meaning the stock prices have fallen below net asset values of these companies.   The list includes public sector banks, top realty players besides the usual suspects from among the debt-crippled firms.   Data compiled from corporate database Capitaline shows the long list has beaten-down names such as  Videocon ,  Reliance Communications ,  Unitech ,  Jaiprakash Associates  and  Jindal Steel .   That, when companies like  SPARC , P&G Hygiene,  HUL ,  Gillette India  and  Bombay Burmah  are trading at P/BVs of 71.94, 54.74, 41.29, 39.06 and 35.18, respectively.   Reliance Communication has been going through hard times. The loss-making telecom operator plans to shut down its voice call service from December 1. Last Friday, telecom regulator Trai directed its customers to move to other networks by the end of the year.   Debt-laden Jindal Steel and  Videocon Industries  figured in the Reserve Bank of India’s second list of loan defaulters referred for  bankruptcy  proceedings. Their names also cropped up in a leaked list of ‘Paradise Papers’ that name companies with suspected shadow investments in offshore destinations.   Other stocks trading at price-to-book values (P/BV) less than 1 include  Shipping Corporation of India , Reliance Infra,  Jindal Saw ,  Indian Overseas Bank ,  Canara Bank ,  Reliance Power ,  Aban Offshore ,  HDIL  and RattanIndia Power.         A P/BV less than 1 shows the stock is available below its book value. Since the P/BV used is relative valuation, one can take a view by comparing the company’s ratio with its peers, says  Satish Kumar , Research Analyst, Fundamental Research Desk, Choice Broking.  A lower P/BV ratio could mean a stock is undervalued. But it may also mean something is fundamentally wrong with the company. One should analyse the reason for the low P/BV ratio before making an investment, said Kumar.   Should you buy?   Taking a buy call on a stock based simply on low P/BV ratio is not prudent. Stock prices reflect expected growth in earnings over long periods with low volatility.   A stock may be quoting at low P/BV because of a highly volatile business, or high leverage or because it is in a mature or declining phase, says Deepak Jasani, Head of retail research at HDFC Securities.   In such cases, one should avoid buying the stock, unless it provides good  dividend yield .   Some analysts believe price-to-earnings (P/E) and other return ratios are better indicators than P/BV, although the last can be used to check whether one is overpaying for a stock, which may otherwise look attractive on other parameters.   Besides P/BV, one should always check price-to-earnings, debt-to-equity, interest coverage and asset turnover ratios and also the  return on equity  of a stock before taking a decision to buy it, said Sahil Kapoor, Chief  Market  Strategist,  Edelweiss  Investment Research.   If a company trades at a P/BV less than 1, this means either investors find the company’s assets overvalued or the company is earning poor returns on its assets, or both.  “Business and management should be top priority while picking a stock to invest in,” he said.   Where to use?   P/BV is often used in capital-intensive businesses or financial businesses with plenty of assets on the books. Book value completely ignores intangible assets such as brand name, goodwill, patent and other intellectual properties created by a company. Hence, service firms are unable to make any sense of it as they carry few tangible assets.   “This ratio is used mainly for valuing financials and seasonal sectors,” said Kumar of Choice Broking.

Blame it on turn of fortunes, sectoral tides or what you may!   Equity benchmark  Sensex , which delivered 418 per cent return during 2001-2010, is up 62 per cent since the beginning of 2011.   Consider this: metal firms  Jindal Steel  and  Vedanta  skyrocketed 23,995 per cent and 17,000 per cent between calendar years 2001 and 2010; but are yet to deliver positive return to investors this decade.    Shares  of  Jindal Steel and Power  surged from Rs 2.96 on January 1, 2001 to Rs 713.20 on December 31, 2010. But on November 10, 2017, the scrip traded at Rs 165.50.   Debt-laden JSPL said its consolidated net loss narrowed to Rs 499 crore during September quarter, 2017. The Naveen Jindal-led firm had posted a net loss of Rs 747.27 crore for the same quarter a year ago.   Vedanta shares surged from Rs 1.92 in January 2001 to Rs 328.40 on December 31, 2010.   The stock recently hit a seven-year high after its FY18 second quarter  earnings . Higher production and strong commodity prices helped it post a 43 per cent year-on-year jump in consolidated net profit for the quarter at Rs 2,036 crore.   The stock hovered around Rs 323 on November 10, 2017.   The main reason for the rally was higher production, and to some extent, high commodity prices supported it. High production in its  zinc ,  aluminium  and  copper  businesses helped,” CEO Kuldip Kaura said at a conference call.    Aban Offshore  and CG Power are next on the list. Aban Offshore traded at Rs 201.20 on November 10, 2017 against Rs 816 on December 31, 2010. The scrip was at Rs 5.89 in January 2001.   CG Power is down 20 per cent this decade after rallying 12,300 per cent during 2001-2010.   Shares of  Bank of India ,  BHEL  and  SAIL , which delivered over 2,500 per cent return between 2001 and 2010, are down over 50 per cent this decade.   BHEL is aiming to double non-power revenue by 2022 and would execute the projects on a turnkey basis. It has identified municipal water, Ganga mission, solar, aerospace, defence and metro and high speed rail projects as key growth drivers.   “Currently, our non-power business is 20 per cent and we are aiming to double it to 40 per cent by 2022,” BHEL Director Amitabh Mathur told PTI.   Brokerage Nirmal Bang Securities has a ‘sell’ rating on BHEL with a target price of Rs 82.    Adani Enterprises  (down 76 per cent this decade), GE Power (down 5 per cent),  Hindustan Construction  (down 21 per cent) and Jammu & Kashmir Bank (down 5 per cent) delivered over 2,000 per cent return each during the first decade.   With over 1,500 per cent return,  Bank of Baroda , Welspun Corporation and  Astrazeneca Pharma  were also among the major gainers between 2001 and 2010. However, these scrips have tanked between 5-18 per cent this decade.   Among others, shares of IOB,  ONGC , NLC  India , RCF,  Tata Power ,  Bajaj Hindusthan  and  Syndicate Bank  have fallen up to 83 per cent between 2011 and 2017. These  stocks  had climbed over 1,000 per cent between January, 2001 and December, 2012.   Anuradha Thakur, joint secretary in the department of investment and public asset management, recently said the ONGC-HPCL merger is likely this financial year.    Dena Bank  and  Kesoram Industries , which also multiplied investor  wealth  during the first decade, are yet to give positive return to investors this decade.   Only those companies which are now the part of BSE500 index were considered for this article. "},

In fact, I like largecap IT more than small and midcap IT,\" he said.  Largecap IT looks good, I would say wait for your exposures accordingly, he added telling that he is increasing exposure in IT stocks over Banks. \"Right now, IT is relatively low. We are just still building positions.  Other experts suggest that investors should buy the dips, instead of booking profits considering the beatdown in the global markets and US stocks entering the bear grip, falling up to 30 per cent from their peaks.  This is a market to invest in and not the time to raise cash, said Mahantesh Sabarad, independent market expert. \"From a portfolio strategy perspective, this is the right time to allocate cash to sectors you think can do well,\" he added.

Analysts said the twin acquisitions by Adani have raised hopes of more such deals in the sector.

Kesoram Industries ,  Mangalam Cement ,  Sanghi Industries , and  Gujarat Sidhee Cement  jumped over 5% each. Ambuja Cement shares also gained 9.3% to Rs 564.9.  The anticipation of bigger acquisitions in the industry is driving the valuation re-rating of regional and smaller players, which are trading at a discount to replacement cost,\" said Gautam Duggad, head of research,  Motilal Oswal Financial Services . \"A few players are finding it difficult to pare their leverage and may be willing to exit the cement business at good valuations.  Days after completing a $6.5-billion buyout of Ambuja Cement and ACC, the new management announced it's targeting an installed capacity of 140 mtpa (Million Tonne Per Annum) over the next five years. The Adani group forayed into the cement business by acquiring Holcim's stake in Ambuja Cement and ACC with a combined grinding capacity of 68 mtpa.  Immediate target companies for Adani could be in regions where it has relatively lower market share, to ensure faster approvals from the Competition Commission of India,\" Devesh Agarwal, analyst,  IIFL Securities . \"Organic expansion is likely to be constrained by other challenges, such as long gestation periods of greenfield projects, costly new limestone mining lease, capacity constraints of equipment suppliers.  Many regional cement players have not added capacities over the last few years and they have lost market share. Analysts said the replacement cost of cement plants is in $100-120 per tonne range. Acquisition of a cement company has been historically at $106-151 per tonne. Many mid- and small-sized companies are trading at an enterprise value per tonne of $48-87. Historically, a valuation premium is assigned to assets based on their ability to generate cash flows and their market presence or operational efficiency.  The overall outlook for the cement sector is also expected to improve in the coming months as the earnings downgrade cycle is likely to bottom out with September 2022 quarter earnings, said analysts.  The December 2022 quarter could see benefits from lower fuel prices, while January-June 2023 could see both better cement demand and prices in a seasonally strong period,\" said Krupal Maniar, analyst, Antique Stock Broking.

The S&P BSE Sensex rallied more than 400 points while the Nifty50 closed above 17500 levels.  Sectorally, buying was seen in capital goods, power, metals, utilities, and auto stocks while some selling was seen in oil & gas stocks.  Stocks that were in focus include  Adani Ports  which fell more than a per cent post June quarter results,  Lemon Tree  rose more than 5 per cent, and  Aegis Logistics  closed with gains of nearly 9 per cent on Monday.  Indian market remained shut on Tuesday on account of a public holiday.   Here's what Jatin Gohil, Technical and Derivative Research Analyst at  Reliance  Securities recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today: Adani Ports: Book Profits  After a sharp recovery from its lowest level of Jun’22 (i.e. 26 per cent from Rs 653), the stock oscillated around its point of polarity, which was placed at around Rs 820.  Above average volume, rise in future open interest, and bearish cross-over on short-term timeframe chart signals, the stock may witness profit booking before it resumes the up-move.  In the case of profit booking, the stock may find support around the Rs 745-740 zone, where the 50-day EMA and 200-day SMA are placed.  However, a stable move above the point of polarity will negate the probable decline in the stock and could take it towards Rs 885-901-925.   Lemon Tree Hotels : Buy  On 5th Aug’22, the stock crossed its short-term supply zone (placed at around Rs 71) convincingly, and later extending its gain, it rose to a 3-year high. Its volume remained above average for the last couple of days, which signals that major market participants are in favour of the bulls.  Upward sloping moving averages and positively poised technical indicators vindicate that undergoing positive momentum will continue, which could lead the stock towards Rs 90 initially and Rs 100 subsequently.  A fresh long position can be initiated at the current juncture and on dips towards Rs 71 for the desired action. On the lower side, the stock will find support around its long-term moving average (100-day SMA), which is placed at Rs 64.   Aegis Logistics: Buy  In late Jul’22, the stock surpassed its medium-term supply zone (placed at around Rs 250) convincingly and after an upward oscillation, it rose to a 52-week high of Rs 290.  The key technical indicators are in favour of the bulls on long-term as well as medium-term timeframe charts.  The stock has the potential to move towards its point of polarity initially (placed at around Rs 340) and its lifetime-high of Rs 388, subsequently.  A fresh long position can be initiated at the current juncture and on dips towards Rs 275 for a probable up-move.  In case of any decline, the stock will find support around its breakout point, which is placed at around Rs 250.

The positive momentum is expected to continue with Nifty eyeing 17,700 – 17,800 zones.   Here's how analysts read the market pulse:  Ajit Mishra, VP - Research, Religare Broking, said Nifty has decisively surpassed the hurdle at 17,400, and is now eyeing 17,800. Apart from the performance of world markets, the last leg of the earnings season coupled with key domestic data like IIP, CPI and WPI would remain on the participants’ radar for cues, he said.   Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst,  HDFC Securities , said the short-term trend of Nifty remains positive with range bound action. “A sustainable move above 17,550 levels could be considered as an upside breakout of the range and that could pull Nifty towards the next important resistance of 17,800-17,900 levels in the near term. Immediate support is placed at 17,430 levels.”   That said, here’s a look at what some key indicators are suggesting for Wednesday’s action:   US market  Wall Street futures pointed to slim gains. On Monday, Wall Street closed mostly flat after blockbuster jobs data last week reinforced expectations the  Federal Reserve  will crack down on inflation, while a revenue warning from chipmaker Nvidia reminded investors of a slowing U.S. economy.   European shares   European shares dipped on Tuesday as investors cautiously waited for key U.S. inflation data later in the week for hints on the Federal Reserve's next move on interest rate increases. The pan-European STOXX 600 index fell 0.3%, retreating after logging its best session in nearly two weeks on Monday.   Tech View  The Nifty50 closed in the green for the second consecutive day on Monday to close above its crucial resistance level of 17,500. It formed a strong bullish candle on the daily charts, suggesting demand at lower levels.   Stocks showing bullish bias  Momentum indicator Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) showed bullish trade setup on the counters of HFCL,  Sumitomo Chemical ,  Tube Investments  and Crisil.  The MACD is known for signaling trend reversals in traded securities or indices. When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement and vice versa.   Stocks signalling weakness ahead  The MACD showed bearish signs on the counters of  Sanofi India ,  Edelweiss Financial ,  United Breweries , Pfizer, Emami and Central Bank. Bearish crossover on the MACD on these counters indicated that they have just begun their downward journey.

That said, here’s a look at what some key indicators are suggesting for Tuesday’s action:   Wall Street  extends losses U.S. stock indexes fell on Monday on worries over the Federal Reserve's plan to keep raising interest rates in its fight against inflation even at the cost of an economic slowdown.  At 09:33 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 265.07 points, or 0.82%, at 32,018.33, the S&P 500 was down 29.87 points, or 0.74%, at 4,027.79, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 82.76 points, or 0.68%, at 12,058.95.  Fed Chair Jerome Powell said on Friday that the U.S. economy would need tight monetary policy \"for some time\" before inflation is under control, knocking Wall Street's main indexes down more than 3%.   European markets lower European shares dropped on Monday, while bond yields surged as comments from central bank policymakers heightened fears of aggressive measures to stamp out inflation amid rising risks of a recession.  The STOXX 600 index fell 0.9% to a more than one-month low, with interest rate-sensitive tech stocks tumbling 1.8%. Germany's 10-year yield rose 10 basis points (bps) to a two-month high.   Tech View: More weakness in the offing  Nifty50  did not respect its 20-day simple moving average (SMA) but somehow managed to form a bullish candle on the daily chart, post a gap-down opening, reflecting intraday recovery. Some analysts believe more weakness is in the offing.

Here's how analysts read the market pulse:  Ruchit Jain, Lead Research,  5paisa.com , said amongst sectoral indices, the pharma index seems to be well poised to play its defensive role and hence stocks within the pharma sector could see a decent upmove.  Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research (Retail), Kotak Securities, said 17,500 would be the key support level for Nifty, while 17,700 could act as a major hurdle for bulls. “Post 17,700 breakout the index could move up to 17,800-17,850. On the flip side, dismissal of 17,500 could increase the selling pressure. Below 17,500, we could expect short term weakness till 17,400-17,300.”  That said, here’s a look at what some key indicators are suggesting for Thursday’s action:   US stocks climb Wall Street  stocks rose on Wednesday, shaking off recent weakness as markets grappled with the likelihood of additional Federal Reserve interest rate hikes.  Analysts warned of more volatility ahead as the Wall Street Journal reported that the Fed appeared likely to enact another 75 basis point interest rate increase.

The broad-based S&P 500 also gained 0.5 percent to 3,926.94, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index advanced 0.4 percent to 11,592.61.   European shares end mixed European markets closed lower Wednesday as investors continued to dwell on the recessionary outlook in the region. Britain's FTSE 100 fell as energy and mining stocks weighed following weak Chinese data, while a jump in utilities shares helped lift Germany's DAX and France's CAC.  At the close, the broad STOXX 600 was down 0.4%, recovering from an earlier drop of more than 1%. Germany's DAX ended up 0.4%, while the FTSE lost 0.9%.   Tech View: Small bullish candle Nifty50  formed a small bullish candle on the daily chart. Analysts said the consolidation in the index is intact, and the trend may continue going ahead. The 17,500 level may offer immediate support to the index, analysts said, adding that the upside will be capped in the 17,700-800 range.   Stocks showing bullish bias Momentum indicator Moving Average Convergence Divergence ( MACD ) showed a bullish trade setup on the counters of Wockhardt,  Shree Cements ,  JK Lakshmi Cement , Firstsource and CESC.  The MACD is known for signaling trend reversals in traded securities or indices.

Stocks signalling weakness ahead The MACD showed bearish signs on the counters of  Aegis Logistics ,  Chambal Fertilisers , Hikal,  Magma Fincorp  and  Eris Lifesciences .

Stocks that witnessed bullish crossovers included  SpiceJet ,  Meghmani Organics ,  JSW Steel ,  Voltas ,  Grasim ,  MOIL ,  KNR Constructions ,  Aegis Logistics ,  Asahi India Glass , Mahanagar Gas and others (see table).   Some of these counters have also witnessed strong volumes, adding further credibility to the emerging trend.   Ashoka Buildcon,  Emkay Global Financial Services ,  National Peroxide ,  Hathway Cable ,  Sunil Agro  and Manpasand Beverages are among the other stocks that witnessed bullish crossovers on Monday.      The MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows a relationship between two moving averages. MACD is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages. A nine-day exponential moving average, called the ‘signal’ line, is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ opportunities.   A ‘buy’ signal occurs when the MACD rises above the signal line and vice-versa.   In technical analysis, the MACD indicator alone may not be sufficient to help decide an investment call.   Traders should make use of other indicators such as Fibonacci Series, RSI, candlestick patterns,  Bollinger Bands  and stochastics to confirm any trend.   It is advisable to consult a financial expert before buying or selling a stock based on such technical indicators.   As many as 30 stocks witnessed bearish crossovers on BSE, signalling a longer bear grip on the  market . The list had names like  Vedanta ,  Hindalco ,  Power Finance ,  Fortis Healthcare ,  Shipping Corporation ,  Parsvnath Developers ,  Jindal Worldwide  and  Hatsun Agro . (See table: MACD crossed below signal line)      The 30-share index closed 235 points, or 0.75 per cent, up at 31,449 on Monday, while the Nifty50 closed 83.35 points, or 0.86 per cent, up at 9,794.   “We expect the Nifty50 to remain under pressure for the next few weeks. The ‘89 EMA’ levels of 9,600 and 9,580 on the daily chart could be tested soon. Traders are advised to remain light and avoid taking undue risks as individual stocks may continue to correct over the next few days,” said Sameet Chavan of Angel Broking.   Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in, said the real test for the bulls lies in holding Monday’s gains.   “If the index consistently manages to sustain above the 9,800 level, there will be some hope of it bottoming out at around 9,700 level. On the downside, if the 9,752 level is broken in the next trading session, then long side traders need to be on alert,” he said.   Understanding MACD      A close look at the chart of SpiceJet shows whenever the MACD line has crossed above the signal line, the stock has always shown an upward momentum.   A similar crossover was recorded on Monday when the Nifty50 settled near 9,800. Shares of SpiceJet settled 6.29 per cent higher at Rs 122. "},

ALSO READ | Dons of Dalal Street    Ekansh has a knack for spotting potential multibaggers in smallcap and midcap segments. He picks easy-to-understand businesses and those which have the ability to generate high returns on capital employed (RoCE) because of their inherent sustainable competitive advantage. Currently, his portfolio includes stocks such as  Cera Sanitaryware ,  Acrysil  and  VST Tillers , among others.   The investing story so far    Ekansh spotted Cera Sanitaryware,  Wim Plast  and Acrysil in 2011, and they have delivered 1,700 per cent, 1,400 per cent and 500 per cent returns, respectively, till now. And he is still holding these stocks.   In 2012, Ekansh bought  VST Tillers Tractors , which has delivered 400 per cent return till date. He also bought  Amara Raja Batteries  at Rs 100 in 2012. The stock is currently trading near Rs 930. He does not hold this stock any more.   In 2013, Ekansh picked  Can Fin Homes  and  Symphony  and they have delivered him 1,500 per cent and 600 per cent returns till date. He bought Can Fin Homes at Rs 165 and Symphony at Rs 205. On May 12, 2017, Can Fin Homes was trading at Rs 2,661 and Symphony at Rs 1,460, indicating a return of 1,500 per cent and 600 per cent, respectively, in three years.   In 2016, he bought  Prima Plastics  which has delivered him over 200 per cent return so far. Two other stocks,  Pokarna  and  DFM Foods  (bought in 2015), have delivered up to 200 per cent returns too.   Where he failed    It has not been a winning trip all the way. And Ekansh doesn’t shy away from talking about the bets that have gone wrong.   He told ETMarkets.com that IPCA Labs and  Eros International  were two picks on which he lost some money. In IPCA Labs, he failed to understand the gravity of the USFDA-related issues and believed the issues would get resolved early, but the company is taking too long to recover. In the case of Eros International, he was not sure of its accounting policies.   Besides error of commission, there have been errors of omission as well. Ekansh says he missed out on investing in  Ajanta Pharma ,  Caplin Point ,  Astral Poly Technik  and  La Opala RG  despite realising their potential early.   Stock-picking strategy    Ekansh prefers stocks that can grow earnings at a rapid pace without requiring access to outside capital markets and have a long runway ahead in terms of expanding market demand and/or shifting from the unorganised to the organised segment.   He keeps an eye on the management prior to selecting a stock and goes for companies which are run by able, honest and owner-managers with interests directly aligned with minority shareholders and can be purchased at valuations where the growth component of the value equation comes free.   As for stock picking, once a stock has been screened on the basis of financial performance, “We compare it to peers to get an overview of the overall industry and understand industry dynamics in more detail. Lastly, we try and reach out to the management through one-on-one meetings, AGMs or through conference calls but the focus is not to get future guidance but to improve our overall understanding of the business and the various variables involved,” he said.      From student to entrepreneur    It was around November 2008 when Ekansh opened his demat account and started investing in equities directly from his pocket money. He was a third-year student of B Tech at that time in Noida. Since, he has become a Sebi-registered analyst and has been running his equity research firm Katalyst Wealth since 2011.   On his research firm, Ekansh said: “When I started Katalyst Wealth, there were not many long-term investment-oriented research outfits. Brokerages want you to buy and sell at regular intervals as they earn their commissions from trades, while real wealth is created over longer term through steady compounding and through reduction in expenses and taxes and that’s how I wanted my clients to build their wealth.”   He was featured in Forbes India in 2015.   Who does he follow    Ekansh likes to read and hear interviews of market legends such as  Raamdeo Agrawal ,  Howard Marks ,  Sanjay Bakshi  and  Vijay Kedia .   “These are all giants of the investing field and there’s so much to learn from their experiences, both good and bad,” he said."},

The 30-share  Sensex , which scaled its lifetime high of 38,989.65 on August 29, closed at 36,134 on Tuesday. Since the end of August, the index has danced to the tune of wobbly crude oil prices, unpredictable rupee and a series of defaults by a leading NBFC player.  Analysts still see volatility to remain ingrained in the market till the results of general elections are out in 2019. At the same time, they expect market fundamentals take a turn for the better in view of easing crude oil prices and stability in the rupee against the US dollar.   Edelweiss Professional Investor Research  in a report has listed 24 emerging investment ideas that can be good bets:   Acrysil :  The company was founded by Ashwin M Parekh in the late 80s in collaboration with Schock & Co (German company), to manufacture composite quartz kitchen sinks. Quartz sinks have seen good growth and Acrysil has been constantly ramping up capacity to meet the growing demand worldwide. Acrysil is targeting revenue of Rs 500 crore in the next five years along with a gradual margin improvement. The stock currently trades at 25 times FY18 P/E.   Team Lease Services:  The company, established in 2002, is one of India’s leading human resource service companies in the organised segment. The company has presence in eight locations, with over 2,250 clients and over 1,700 core employees across the country. Improvement in core staffing business productivity coupled with volume-led growth in both general and IT staffing will further bolster the expansion.   AU Small Finance Bank (ASFB):  The bank is one of the well-diversified small finance banks with an asset under management of Rs 20,219 crore as on Q2FY19. ASFB has persistently worked as retail focused, customer-centric premier asset financing NBFC. The management expects to build a retail customer-centric bank with a view of growing assets 30-35 per cent per annum and reach $10 billion assets by 2022.   Emami Paper Mills (EPML):  It is the sixth largest paper manufacturer in India, with a paper capacity of 3,50,000 MTPA in Balasore, Odisha. EPML has a positive outlook on expectation of improved profitability in newsprint segment and rising market share gain prospects in consumer packaging segment. However, the company has quite large amount of debt (mainly foreign currency denominated), with high debt/EBITDA of 5.76x based on H1FY19 financials. Furthermore, the company is currently trading at an expensive EV/Ebitda multiple of 10.4 times based on H1FY19 financials.    Emmbi Industries:  The company is one of the region’s most well-established brands in the field of woven polyethylene and polypropylene product manufacturing. It has been continuously focusing on increasing share of high margin value-added products: 1) advance composite business; 2) water conservation business; and 3) Agri products.   Finolex Industries :  Finolex Industries, incorporated in 1981 is the largest PVC pipes manufacturer in India. The company started as a rigid PVC pipe manufacturer before going in for backward integration in 1994 to manufacture PVC resins. It reported strong results with improvement in realization and inventory gain. Both the business division showed a good growth in the Ebitda profitability; margin expansion as well as in terms of absolute growth. However, with the narrowing PVC/EDC spread will directly impact the profitability of PVC resin business in coming quarters.    Visaka industries:  Visaka Industries was established in 1985. The company has two main divisions; Building Products division which manufactures cement asbestos products as well as fibre cement flat products and the Textile division. Edelweiss has a ‘Buy’ rating on this stock with a target price of Rs 800 based on 15 times FY20E earning.   SP Apparels:  Strong client relationship and niche segment presence to drive growth in tough times. Edelweiss believes that most negatives are factored in, there is uncertainty regarding end customer demand.   Rico Auto Industries:  The company is a key manufacturer of ferrous and aluminium casting and machining components used in the automotive space supplying to various models across leading automobile OEMs in the Indian and international markets. Some of the key drivers that could spur Rico’s financial performance are cost reduction measures, entry in high-realisation, complex aluminium products business, strong annual order book mainly from overseas OEMs ensures healthy growth going ahead in both revenue and profitability.   Oberoi Realty:  Oberoi Realty is one of the leading developers in Mumbai with developments across Residential, Offices, Retail, Hospitality and Education sector. With the recent correction in the realty sector post-liquidity crisis, the stock at the current market price of Rs 425, trades at more than 40 per cent to its NAV value. The NAV calculation captures the value emerging from Oberoi’s existing and planned residential development potential, ongoing and upcoming development in commercial and hospitality division.   Other companies:  Future Supply Chain Solution, Godawari Power,  Heritage Foods , Indostar Capital Finance, Intellect Design Arena,  Jamna Auto Industries , Jindal Stainless Hisar, Magma Fincorp, Minda Industries, Prabhat Dairy, Prism Johnson, Ramkrishna Forgings,  Vinati Organics  and Welspun stood among other emerging investment ideas in the list of Edelweiss Professional Investor Research.

However, net profit  growth  may moderate to single-digit levels as  earnings  slow at some  companies  in the oil and gas, automobiles, metals, and pharma sectors. According to ETIG estimates, the sample's revenue is expected to grow 18.8% from the year earlier while net profit may increase 5%.  Stocking up of goods before the festive season may help top line growth, going by the GST and advance tax collections, said Deepak Jasani, retail research head,  HDFC  Securities.  The September quarter results could bring in a moderate rise in top line year-on-year and sequential basis,\" he said, while indicating that profitability will be tricky to forecast considering the inflation factor.  Second-quarter earnings will be led by the banking and finance, consumer, and automobile sectors and dragged down by commodity sectors such as metals and oil and gas, said Gautam Duggad, institutional research head,  Motilal Oswal Financial Services . \"We expect companies in our coverage universe and  Nifty earnings  excluding metals and oil and gas to post a 30% year-on-year growth in the September quarter,\" he said.  According to ETIG estimates, the sample's operating margin is likely to shrink by 290 basis points year-on-year to 18.4% following high input cost inflation.    Areas of Concern    On the positive side, there may be a 50 basis point improvement in margins from the previous quarter, reflecting the effect of softening commodity prices. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  In the coming quarters, analysts expect demand to improve amid concerns over expectations of a recession in the western economies, the rupee depreciating further against the dollar and rising domestic interest rates.  We expect healthy corporate earnings momentum to continue. India's interest rate and currency management has been very strong compared with global central banks,\" Duggad said, while highlighting elevated crude oil prices and escalation in geopolitical tensions as concern areas.  Jasani expects another round of minor downgrades in the Nifty 50 earnings per share after the second-quarter results season as analysts cut back aggressive projections of profit growth due to raw material inflation effect.   Sector Outlook    Automobiles   It will be a mixed bag for the auto sector. The passenger car companies will post superior earnings growth thanks to the low base effect and a slight margin improvement.  Maruti Suzuki 's volume grew 42% year-on-year while M&M and  Tata Motors  both were among those showing the highest quarterly passenger vehicle volumes. However, muted domestic and export demand may curb earnings growth of two-wheeler companies barring  Eicher Motors .   Banking, finance   The September quarter was marked by better retail and small and medium enterprise (SME) credit offtake while deposit growth remained muted. Since private banks have a higher proportion of repo rate-linked loans, further increases in the policy rate are expected to benefit their net interest margins more than public sector banks. Asset quality is expected to be stable.   Cement   For the September 2022 quarter, large cement companies are likely to focus on volume growth given high input costs. Revenues of  Ultratech Cement ,  ACC ,  Ambuja Cements ,  Shree Cement  and Dalmia Bharat are likely to grow 11-14% year-on-year. Net profit may increase 15-20% because of effective cost management and the low base effect.   FMCG   FMCG companies are expected to show value-led revenue growth for the September quarter as volume growth will be muted amid higher product prices. Despite the easing of commodity prices, the companies have not passed on the benefit to consumers in a bid to protect margins.   InfoTech   A sharp drop in the pound and the euro of 5-6% sequentially against the dollar will likely offset the benefit of over 3% decline in the rupee against the dollar, thereby affecting the revenue growth of IT exporters. Management commentary on deal momentum, employee attrition, and forex management will be crucial.   Metals   Metal companies including ferrous and base metals are expected to report a sharp drop in earnings sequentially and year-on-year amid a fall in prices. While this will impact realisations, higher raw material costs will hurt margins.   Oil & Gas   The energy sector continued to face headwinds in the September quarter. The benchmark Singapore gross refining margin (GRM) fell sharply while petrol spreads turned negative. In addition, the growth of upstream companies was capped by windfall levies. The marketing loss on retail fuel for oil marketing companies has started moderating.   Pharma   Pharma companies are likely to post a modest performance for the quarter. There has been an easing in input cost pressures, helping with margins. The performance of India and emerging markets is expected to compensate for the price erosion in the US market.   "},

The Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) has passed the special resolution proposing to raise Rs 20,000 crore by issuing securities on a preferential basis to Harmonia Trade and Investment Ltd, an Adani group entity, with 91.37 per cent votes, Ambuja Cements said in a regulatory update.    Resolutions to appoint Adani Group Chairman Gautam Adani, his son  Karan Adani  and two directors and four independent directors on the board of Ambuja Cements were also approved by the shareholders.    The proposal for the appointment of Gautam Adani was approved with 96.51 per cent of the valid votes cast in favour, while the appointment of Karan Adani received 99.96 per cent votes, as per the scrutiniser's report on the voting results.    The shareholder also approved all special resolutions related to the appointment of independent directors, the amendment to the Articles of Association (AoA) and the change of its registered office to Ahmedabad-based Adani Corporate House.    Gautam Adani, who is now the chairman of the board of Ambuja Cements after its takeover by the Adani group, was not present at the EGM. His son Karan Adani chaired the EGM in his absence.    Ambuja Cements, which also owns 50.05 per cent of  ACC Ltd , had called an EGM of the shareholders on Saturday.    Earlier this week, institutional investor advisory firm IiAS had recommended the shareholders of Ambuja Cements to vote against the proposal to raise Rs 20,000 crore from the Adani family firm.    It had also advised shareholders to vote against the appointment of Ameet Desai and Purvi Sheth as independent directors of the company.    Ambuja Cements had sought shareholders' approval on 12 resolutions, which included preferential allotment of 47.74 crore warrants at a price band of Rs 418.87 to Harmonia Trade and Investment Ltd, totalling Rs 20,001 crore, in one or more tranches.    Last month, the Adani group announced the completion of the acquisition of Ambuja Cements and  ACC  for a total consideration of USD 6.5 billion (about Rs 53,800 crore), which includes the buyout of Swiss major Holcim's stake in the two firms and subsequent open offers to minority shareholders.    Days after the acquisition, the Adani group pledged its entire stake in Ambuja Cements and ACC Ltd worth USD 13 billion (around Rs 1.07 lakh crore) to the Hong Kong branch of Deutsche Bank.    Adani acquired Ambuja Cement and ACC through Mauritius-based SPV Endeavour Trade and Investment Limited (ETIL), which is owned by Xcent Trade and Investment Ltd (XTIL)."},

The company has also sought approvals for the appointment of Adani Group chairman Gautam Adani, his son  Karan Adani  and two directors and four independent directors on the board.    In its voting advisory, IiAS has said: \"Assuming full conversion of the warrants, the issue will lead to a dilution of 19.4 per cent on the expanded capital base which is high. Promoter shareholding will increase to 70.3 per cent from the current 63.1 per cent.\"    Moreover, the issue price is at a 16.3 per cent discount to the current market price of Rs 500.2 and at an 8.8 per cent premium to the acquisition price from the Holcim Group.    The advisory firm said Ambuja Cements already had a cash and cash equivalent balance of Rs 3,840 crore on a standalone basis and Rs 8,500 crore on a consolidated basis.    It understands the rationale for the capital infusion, given the substantial capex plans of the company.    \"Notwithstanding, we do not favour preferential issue of warrants to promoters since it gives promoters the option to ride the stock price for 18 months. Subsequently, if the promoters decide not to subscribe to the remaining 75 per cent, it could have material implications for the company's long-term plans. We do not encourage warrants to promoters and rather all the money be brought in upfront,\" it said.    The voting advisory also asked shareholders to vote against the appointment of Ameet Desai as an independent director. Desai, who had held various positions with Adani Group, did not have a cooling-off period.    While for Purvi Sheth, the report said she serves on the boards of four listed companies and is also the managing director at Shilputsi Consultants. Therefore, her high number of directorships on listed companies are not in keeping with the spirit of the regulation, it added.    Last month Adani Group announced the completion of the acquisition of Ambuja Cements and  ACC  for a total consideration of USD 6.5 billion, which includes the buyout of Swiss major Holcim's stake in the two firms and subsequent open offers to minority shareholders.

Hold GATI for more than a year to minimise your loss with a target price of around Rs 100.

Hold GM Breweries with a target price of around Rs 600 which is a fair value of 12 PE on one-year forward earnings. Considering attractive investments it holds in insurance, home loan and consumer finance ventures, Reliance Capital looks attractive even after adjusting for the exposure to the group companies.

I hold NTPC, Premier Explosives, BHEL and Vedanta for more than 5 years. Should I exit any of this or continue to hold. — VENU G  Hold NTPC with a target price of around Rs 195 considering substantial expansion of its capacities and also price being close to its book value. Hold Premier Explosives with a target price of Rs 250 considering significant growth opportunities for explosives demand from mining industry. You may sell Vedanta if it moves beyond Rs 250 considering subdued metal prices and possibility of hike in oil cess by the government due to tight budgetary conditions.   I hold HEG, Graphite India, Goa Carbon and Phillips Carbon Black. Please advise if I should hold or sell these shares. — JIMMY BARIA  Sell Goa Carbon as it has posted significant loss in the September quarter as against substantial rofits a year ago — this poor performance may continue in the short term. If there is any recovery of 5 per cent o 10 per cent, then you may sell remaining three stocks as the prices of graphite electrodes and carbon blacks are highly cyclical in nature and current bull run in these stock prices is not sustainable in the long run.   I have 100 shares of Supreme Petrochemical at Rs 267.

Can Aban Offshore at current market price be a multi bagger in next 5-10 year’s time? —NIKHIL SIDDHANTA  In my view, possible only if crude price goes close to $150 a barrel.

Please advise me whether to hold it or book the losses and invest in some other script. — PRAVESH  Even after the crash, Titagarh Wagons seems to be trading at a fair valuation – you may sell this stock and buy Andhra Sugar (predominantly a chemical company) to make up for the losses in the medium to long term. Future Consumer valuation is still stretched at current price also – you may sell it if it recovers 10 per cent from the current level. Please hold ICICI Prudential as after the crash it trades at attractive valuation of around 2 times embedded value for the current year.

Asian shares tick higher Asian shares ticked up in early Tuesday trade, supported by Wall Street gains although sentiment was tempered ahead of the U.S. midterm elections, the first major electoral test of President Donald Trump’s big tax cuts and hostile trade policies, Reuters reported.  MSCI 's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.15 per cent while Japan's Nikkei gained 0.5 per cent, a day after both fell more than one percent.

But there were at least 318 index constituents that required at least 20 per cent rally to reclaim their one-year highs. 22 of these stocks were required to multifold if they were to revisit their peaks, data compiled from corporate database AceEquity suggests.  At Friday's close of Rs 243.55, Dilip Buildcon required a 207 per cent surge to revisit its October 2021 high of Rs 749.30. The company has been reporting losses quarter after quarter.  In the June quarter, it reported a consolidated loss of Rs 53.94 crore. It also posted a loss of Rs 55.51 crore in March quarter and a loss of Rs 19.16 crore in December quarter.  Tanla Platforms  needed 187.73 per cent rally over Friday's close of Rs 727.90 to revisit its January high of Rs 2,094.40. The June quarter numbers of this company were also poor. There were also concerns over aggressive pricing by a competitor in a large enterprise account.  The management commentary on Tanla’s and peer earnings calls as well as our channel checks suggest that such disruptive pricing is one-off in nature, with the aforesaid telco bidding at reasonable prices in subsequent tenders. While we see limited risk of contagion of pricing disruption in other accounts, this episode also underscores the increasing competitive intensity in the A2P SMS space,\" IIFL said in a note.   Agencies  Three stocks  Brightcom Group ,  Tata Teleservices  (Maharashtra) and  Zomato  require a 175-176 per cent rally to revisit their 52-week highs.

The stock has also been in a recovery mode, having risen some 15 per cent in the last one month.  PB Fintech,  One97 Communications ,  Metropolis Healthcare ,  Lux Industries  and  Vaibhav Global , were some of the stocks that needed a 150-per cent plus rally to revisit their 52-week highs.  On One97 Communications, the stock plunged after the IPO on concerns around lack of visibility on profitability, governance issues and higher valuations.  This scrip has risen 5 per cent in the last one month. \"The recent upmove in the stock due to guidance on turning Ebitda (ex-ESOP) positive by September 2023 and softness in valuations, owing to CG issues being raised by proxy advisors,\" said Emkay Global.   We believe One 97 Communications will not only have to deliver on its promise to turn profitable, but also steer clear of CG/regulatory issues, to drive-up valuations/returns for investors in the long term,\" it said.  In case of Metropolis Healthcare, June quarter results were disappointing marred by weak topline as well as weak operating performance, due to higher costs and adverse mix which resulted in a sharp drop in margins. Sharekhan has revised downwards its FY23-24 estimates by 9-11 per cent.  For PB Fintech, Q1 numbers were a beat on several counts such as lower Ebitda loss, growth in insurance premium and healthy uptick in credit disbursals. Besides, there was a clear pivot in management commentary on profitability according to analysts. The median price of nine analysts stood at Rs 790 for PB Fintech.   Lux Industries and Vaibhav Global are not widely tracked stocks.

On the contrary,  Tata Teleservices  (Maharashtra) extended its weakness and dropped 11 per cent to settle at Rs 120.3 on Friday. The scrip is plunging on the back of weak fundamentals and reported equity dilution to the government at heavy discount.

At 9:49 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 176.38 points, or 0.50 per cent, at 34,967.93 and the S&P 500 was down 17.99 points, or 0.41 per cent, at 4,404.31. The Nasdaq Composite was down 78.17 points, or 0.53 per cent, at 14,762.54.   European shares slip after China stks tank  European stocks lost ground on Tuesday after falls in Chinese shares and Reckitt Benckiser's warning on margins ahead of earnings updates from big fashion retailers later in the day. The pan-European STOXX index fell 0.5% in its second straight session of losses. Worries about tighter regulation of China's heavyweight technology sector fuelled a selloff in global markets this week despite optimism about the ongoing U.S. and European earnings season.   Tech View: Nifty forms bearish candle  Nifty50  on Tuesday closed below the 15,750 level and formed a large bearish candle on the daily scale. But analysts do not see it as a sign of weakness as the 50-pack index has been trading in the broader 15,900-600 range for 29 sessions now. Chances are the index may find good support near the lower end of the range, they said, adding that the ongoing consolidation may continue going ahead.    F&O:  India VIX  jumps 6%  India VIX moved up 6.29 per cent from 12.45 to 13.23 level. A spike in volatility since the last two sessions is giving profit booking decline, but overall lower volatility indicates that buying interest could emerge again at meaningful support zones. Options data suggested a broader trading range in between 15,600 and 15,900 levels.   Stocks showing bullish bias  Momentum indicator Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) showed bullish trade setup on the counters of Jindal Saw, Tata Steel BSL, Phillips Carbon, Gabriel India, LT Foods, Sterling and Wilson, Vakrangee, Titagarh Wagons, Welspun Corp, Max Financial Services, ICICI Pru Life, APL Apollo Tubes, Pfizer,  Westlife Development , TCI, Hitech Corporation, Godfrey Phillips, Ajanta Pharma, Mold-Tek Packaging, Nxtdigital and NBI Industrial Finance.   The MACD is known for signalling trend reversals in traded securities or indices.

Traders welcomed a reprieve from the recent brutal sell-off.  Here's how analysts read the market pulse:  The steep decline of May 19 was arrested near the swing low of 15,735, said Gaurav Ratnaparkhi of Sharekhan, who added that the March low of 15,671 offered additional support on the downside.  The daily timeframe of the  Nifty50  indicates that the index has made a double bottom around the 15,735 levels, said Subash Gangadharan, Senior Technical and Derivative Analyst, HDFC Securities.  Despite the rebound, we feel the market has not reached its bottom, since price patterns on the Nifty50 show that the uptrend has been significantly harmed, said Yesha Shah, Head of Equity Research, Samco Securities.  That said, here’s a look at what some key indicators are suggesting for Monday’s action:   Wall Street  ends mixed after punishing week   Wall Street ended mixed on Friday after a volatile session that saw Tesla slump and other growth stocks also lose ground.  The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq logged their seventh straight week of losses, their longest losing streak since the end of the dotcom bubble in 2001. The Dow suffered its eighth consecutive weekly decline, its longest since 1932 during the Great Depression.  The S&P 500 spent most of the session in negative territory and at one point was down just over 20% from its Jan. 3 record high close before ending down 18% from that level and flat for the day.  Closing down 20% from that record level would confirm the S&P 500 has been in a bear market since reaching that January high, according to a common definition.  The tech-heavy Nasdaq was last down about 27% from its record close in November 2021.   European stocks close higher  European shares rose on Friday, with a boost from defensive sectors after hopes of an economic recovery in major trading partner China were bolstered by more central bank stimulus, though they still ended the week in the red.   Travel and tourism stocks, financial services , healthcare and utilities led gains in Europe, rising between 1.5% and 2.0%, lifting the pan-European STOXX 600 index 0.7%. Over the week, though, the main index was down 0.5%.   Tech View: bullish candle formed  Nifty50 capitalised on a strong gap-up start as the index ended almost at day's higher. In the process, it breached its immediate resistance level of 16,150 and formed a bullish candle both daily and weekly scales. Analysts said more upside is in the offing and advised traders to be cautiously bullish for the week ahead.   F&O: Resistance at 16,400  It was one of the most difficult weeks for traders as markets have oscillated sharply on both sides. The alternate bouts of buying and selling perplexed market participants as to the primary trend of the index, said Ruchit Jain, Lead Research, 5paisa.com.  In our view, the recent activity in the Nifty, where it has taken support several times as it approached 15,700-15,800 and has faced resistance around 16,400 has changed the trend from down to sideways, he added.   Stocks showing bullish bias  Momentum indicator Moving Average Convergence Divergence ( MACD ) showed a bullish trade setup on the counters of BHEL, Zomato,  Hindustan Copper , HDFC Bank,  Coal India , Zee Entertainment,  LIC Housing Finance , Marico, Sun Pharma and  Granules India .  The MACD is known for signalling trend reversals in traded securities or indices. When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement and vice versa.   Stocks signalling weakness ahead  The MACD showed bearish signs on the counters of  Surani Steel Tubes ,  Solex Energy  and  Alps Industries . A bearish crossover on the MACD on these counters indicated that they had just begun their downward journey.   Most active stocks in value terms  Reliance Industries  (Rs 2,584.08 crore), Infosys (Rs 1,527.95 crore), Dr Reddy's Labs (Rs 1,043.03 crore), TCS (Rs 1,008.75 crore),  Tata Motors  (Rs 981.3 crore), HDFC Bank (Rs 913.10 crore) and ITC (Rs 907.09 crore) were among the most active stocks on NSE in value terms.  Higher activity on a counter in value terms can help identify the counters with the highest trading turnovers in the day.   Most active stocks in volume terms  ITC (Shares traded: 3.23 crore), Tata Motors (Shares traded: 2.35 crore), NTPC (Shares traded: 1.78 crore), SBI (Shares traded: 136 crore),  ICICI Bank  (Shares traded: 1.17 crore) and Infosys (Shares traded: 1.05 crore) were among the most traded stocks in the session on NSE.   Stocks showing buying interest  Welspun Corp ,  Hindustan Aeronautics  and ITCs stocks witnessed strong buying interest from market participants as they scaled their fresh 52-week highs, signaling bullish sentiment.   Stocks seeing selling pressure  Container Corporation of India ,  Honeywell Automation , Supreme Industries and  Firstsource Solutions  witnessed strong selling pressure and hit their 52-week lows, signalling bearish sentiment on the counters.   Sentiment meter favours bears  Overall, market breadth favoured losers as 2,474 stocks ended in the black, while 875 names settled with cuts. "},

The headline index formed a negative divergence pattern on the daily chart after back to back hanging man candle formations signalled consistent profit bookings in the past few sessions. Some analysts say formation of negative divergence pattern could signal tiredness of the market at the new highs and the profit booking could emerge from near all-time highs.  Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst, HDFC Securities said, “The market was seen struggling at the new highs, which could open further consolidation or weakness from the highs. Immediate support needs to be watched at 13,000 levels.\" He also added that on the upper side, 13,250 level could act as a key overhead resistance.  “The broad market is continuing its buoyancy, led by rally in mid &  smallcap stocks . This trend can continue, given the gap between the pricing of main and broad stocks. Today, largecaps are mildly underperforming, in which financial stocks did contribute to the upside, but weakness in HDFC Bank post the RBI curbs limited the upside.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index fell 0.14% with banks leading declines, while production indecision by OPEC+ member weighed on crude prices.   Tech view: Nifty50 forms bearish candle Nifty made a fresh all-time high above 13,200 level on Thursday, but could not hold on to the gains as the session progressed. The index formed a bearish candle on the daily chart that resembled a ‘Bearish Belt Hold’ pattern as it saw selling from the word go, before recovering some ground at the end. Such a formation, following a Dragonfly Doji pattern in the previous session, suggested that the bears were getting the upper hand.

It is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages. A nine-day exponential moving average called the ‘signal line’, is plotted on top of the MACD to indicate ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ opportunities.  When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement and vice versa.  Data showed 30 stocks are showing bearish trends. They included  Indian Bank , Future Retail, SBI Life Insurance, Radico Khaitan, Alembic Pharma, L&T Infotech and S Chand & Company.  The MACD indicator should not be seen in isolation, as it may not be sufficient to take a trading call, just the way a fundamental analyst cannot give a ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ recommendation using a single valuation ratio.   ETMarkets.com  This is because MACD is a trend-following indicator. Though traders can increase the sensitivity of MACD by using shorter moving averages for computing MACD (e.g. 5-day and 12-day moving averages), the lag effect will still be there. Hence, traders should make use of other indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci Series, candlestick patterns, and Stochastic to confirm an emerging trend.  On Tuesday, the Nifty50 was trading at 15,786.20 at 2 pm, down 27 points or 0.17 per cent.  Monday's high of 15,915 would be seen as an immediate hurdle.

Some analysts believe it is better to stay away from PSU stocks now, especially since better businesses are available in the same sectors.  “We have a choice in many sectors, where you have PSU names plus some very robust private sector names. Yes, there is a valuation difference, and obviously, the PSU sector does offer very cheap valuation, but clearly the way the businesses are run is rather different. For some time, we have kept away from the PSU space and I am not sure I have seen enough yet to entice me back,” said Jonathan Schiessl, an emerging market expert, who was earlier with IIFL.  However, SBI MF has not shunned all PSU names. It is still bought select names from the power sector, as India broke all records of electricity consumption this calendar.  Fund managers bought 3.14 crore shares of NHPC and nearly 62 lakh shares of PowerGrid. It also added Bank of Baroda and Concor, two of the government’s disinvestment candidates.  Besides, it bought 20 lakh to 1 crore shares of Crompton Greaves Consumer Electricals,  V-Guard Industries , Tata Steel, TVS Motor, UPL, Muthoot Finance, Ashok Leyland, Equitas Holdings and Axis Bank.  “Yet at a time when our in-house equity market sentiment measure suggests overheated condition, which to us has been a key tactical risk, taper fears can potentially bring about volatility. This could be especially pronounced in pockets with speculative excesses,” SBI MF said in a recent note.   “We would, however, recommend using any correction to add good quality pro-cyclical assets and stocks to position for the next several years of likely uptick in economic activity and corporate earnings in India,” it said.  Meanwhile, the fund house took fresh positions in Avanti Feeds,  Brigade Enterprises , Dodla Dairy, India Pesticides, Indian Bank, KNR Constructions, Manappuram Finance and Sona BLW Precision Forgings. Three of them are last month’s debutants.   At the same time, the fund house exited Barbeque-Nation Hospitality and JSW Energy.  SBI Mutual Fund is the top fund house in India with assets under management (AUM) at Rs 5.24 lakh crore, widening the gap against the rest. ICICI Pru AMC stands at the second spot with an AUM at Rs 4.29 lakh crore and HDFC AMC third with Rs 4.18 lakh crore.  "},

Ricky Kirpalani, Lead Sponsor, First Water Capital Fund (AIF) said that after a strong 2021 for the mid and smallcaps, investors have started looking for reasons to take some money off the table, resulting in a decent correction.  He said that healthy deflation in rich valuations along with global worries such as hawkish commentary from the Federal Reserve, inflationary worries and geopolitical concerns is weighing on their counters.   ETMarkets.com  The correction in some stocks is owing to the underlying fundamentals of the company and the resilience to bounce back post covid setbacks, said Neha Khanna, Director, ValPro - a tech based investment banking platform.  The dips are a result of such valuations being streamlined by the markets, she added. \"This can also be observed in contrast by companies with consistent compounding performance as showcased in Q3 results most recently.  Not all mid and smallcaps are wealth destroyers as at least a dozen of them have jumped over 35 per cent during 2022, with DB realty being a multibagger.

His name was not mentioned in the company's shareholders list in the March quarter, suggesting he either fully exited the stock during the quarter or reduced his stake to below 1 per cent. The stock traded in a tight range of Rs 100-110 during the quarter, only to rally later.  Firstsource Solutions’ Chairman Sanjiv Goenka had in an interview to ET NOW said his company was in the process of transitioning from being a BPO player to being a platform and transformation player. This past quarter, Goenka said, 17 per cent of order wins were from digital. \"A year ago we did not have digital at all. We have just won a very major contract in the healthcare space. It is the largest deal that has been struck in the sector. It is a $210-million deal that we along with our partner had bid. Our share is about $110 million. We won it with TCS and Infosys as competitors. It was a little bit like a David versus Goliath kind of a competition. It is the beginning of a transformation, and transformation is not easy, but it is something that is definitely happening,\" he said.  Goenka said it was beginning to manifest in the revenue mix, in the wins mix and in the way the company was being viewed by its clients.  Firstsource has revised down its FY22 revenue growth outlook to 14.5-15 per cent YoY in constant currency terms from 15-18 per cent. This comes in the wake of challenges in the collection business and a talent shortage in onshore markets. It kept its margin guidance same at 11.8–12.3 per cent for FY22.  Edelweiss Securities said: \"We believe the challenges in the mortgage business are transitory and talent shortage will impact it in the short term. However, it will lead to higher offshoring going forward, which would be margin accretive. The company continues to progress towards its digital journey as 17 per cent of deal wins this quarter were digital in nature. The stock is trading at a sharp discount to IT mid-caps, and an increase in digital revenue contribution would drive multiple re-rating for the stock.\"   Emkay said the stock has corrected about 15 per cent in the last one month and the performance miss in Q2 was largely due to temporary factors. Growth should bounce back strongly from gteh March quarter. “The stock may consolidate in the near term due to the lack of immediate catalysts. Considering attractive valuations, we upgrade the stock to buy with a target of Rs220 at 21 times September 2023 EPS,” it said.  The BPM firm posted a 28.3 per cent rise in consolidated net profit to Rs 135 crore for the September quarter, compared with Rs 105.2 crore in the year-ago period. Revenue from operations grew 20.3 per cent to Rs 1,418.2 crore from Rs 1,178.3 crore a year ago, it said. The company said its headcount stood at 27,835 as on September 30, 2021. It added 15 new clients during the quarter, creating a robust deal pipeline. The stock is up 78 per cent year-to-date. "},

This is even as its fourth-quarter guidance fell short of analyst expectations.   There remain concerns over supply-side constraints such as elevated attrition, weak employee addition, and also over volatility in foreign exchange. But the results of the US-based firm's outsourcing division, keenly followed by analysts here in India, suggest fears of slowdown globally are not impacting the decision-making of IT clients, at least for now. For now, analysts are busy picking their Indian IT bets ahead of the first-quarter earnings season.  The demand environment remains supportive, and the weakening macro environment has not yet started impacting growth in the sector. While supply-side challenges remain a concern, with elevated attrition and lower headcount addition, Accenture's margin guidance implies a stable margin performance in FY23,\" said  Motilal Oswal  Securities, as it picks  Infosys ,  HCL Tech  and  TCS  as its preferred picks in the Tier I IT space.  Accenture raised FY22 revenue growth guidance to 25.5–26.5 per cent in local currency terms from 24–26 per cent while maintaining its margin guidance at 15.2 per cent. The IT major, however, cut the top end of EPS guidance by 11 bps, as it now incorporates headwinds of 15 cents from Russia and 14 cents from forex incrementally.  Accenture's strong Q3 performance and upward revision in local currency revenue growth guidance for FY22 indicate a robust demand environment, said  Emkay Global , which added that broad-based healthy demand, steady revenue growth and healthy order booking in outsourcing (10.5 per cent  YoY YTD ) augur well for its Indian IT peers.  Accenture saw attrition rise sequentially in Q3 and management indicated that the uptick was seasonal and the bulk of it was driven by India. The management indicated a conducive environment for price increases, but price increases continue to lag wage inflation. Robust demand and steady decision-making alleviate any concerns over near-term growth; however, elevated attrition and volatility in foreign exchange pose challenges to earnings,\" Emkay said.  Among tier 1 names, the brokerage likes Infosys, HCL Tech,  Wipro ,  Tech Mahindra  and TCS in the pecking order.  Mindtree , LTI, Mphasis  Firstsource Solutions ,  Persistent Systems ,  Route Mobile  Birlasoft and  Eclerx Services  are its midcap picks in the same pecking order.  Accenture has yet again delivered higher-than-expected revenue growth despite a harsher currency headwind of 5 per cent than the expectation of 4 per cent. The management raised revenue growth guidance for a third consecutive quarter despite the increase in currency headwind from 3 per cent to 4.5 per cent for FY22. Bookings were strong too, with a book to bill of more than 1x. Accenture’s strong performance and solid commentary supports our thesis of a robust tech upcycle,\"  Edelweiss  said.  The brokerage said that the outsourcing growth remains high and bookings also remain strong, which bodes well for Indian IT services companies, as it showed its preference for HCL, Infosys and TCS among largecaps and  Coforge , LTI and Mindtree among midcaps. The brokerage prefers Zensar,  Birlasoft  and Firstsource, among smallcaps.  Accenture expects revenues for Q4FY22 to be in the range of $15-15.5 billion, an increase of 20-24 per cent in local currency, which incorporated a negative 8 per cent foreign-exchange impact YoY.  Nomura  India said cross-currency could be a material headwind to the reported growth of Indian IT companies in FY23F. Dollar strength against European currencies is likely to negate the positive impact on margins from the rupee depreciation against the dollar.  Pricing increase may act as a key lever in margin defence. Accenture noted that it has begun to see some effects of price increases in 3QFY22, and it expects further boosts in coming quarters. Newer contracts are coming in at better pricing, which may help to partly offset margin headwinds in 2HFY23F and FY24F, particularly from higher-than-usual salary hikes, in our view,\" Nomura said adding Infosys and TechM remains it only Buy calls in the sector.

Although over 125 cases have been referred before NCLT by either financial creditors or operational creditors, this is the first instance that an employee has approached the bankruptcy court. If these employees are able to recover their dues, it will set a precedent for thousands of other employees who do not have the wherewithal to take on the management to recover their dues.   The Chennai bench of NCLT admitted the application filed by three employees for commencement of the corporate insolvency resolution process and has appointed P Sriram as interim insolvency professional (IIP). Employees said that Aruna Hotels failed to pay arrears of salary , gratuity and leave salary of these employees.   In the case of Aruna Hotels, the court referred to the case of an employee D Ramjees, who joined as junior assistant and rose to the rank of company secretary. He had made a demand of Rs 2.6 crore but the respondent (the company) had denied the liability. What went in favour of the employee was that a day after the petition was filed before the NCLT on April 3, the MD, in a letter, acknowledged the liability of clear ing these arrears. The court has directed the insolvency professional to take charge and declared moratori um of any legal ac tion of recovery against the company till the completion of insolvency process. The court has also directed the other two employees N Krishnan and C Ganapathy to approach IIP with their claims.   These developments come at a time when lenders are keeping a close watch on how the new code will help them recover their dues particularly after  Essar Steel , one of 12 defaulters, has dragged RBI to court stating that it was discriminated against when compared to other defaulters. In June, RBI had asked banks to 12 large defaulters to move the NCLT to recover their dues.   Since IBC has come into effect early this year, a variety of cases would set a precedent for future disputes.Earlier, in a case of Ms Schweitzer Systemtek India versus Phoenix ARC, the court has ruled that the borrower can't escape liquidation of personal assets by simply filing for bankruptcy that allows moratorium on all legal proceeding against the company of rich promoters."},

IT stocks in the recent weeks have remained under pressure lately, with stocks eroding up to two-third of their values from their respective 52-week highs, thanks to muted financial performance and pressure on margins.  Amid the buzz recession buzz, investors are pondering if the worst is over for IT stocks.   “In the near term, maybe for a quarter or two, we may not see too much disappointment on the revenue front but for the next year, definitely the uncertainty on revenues is much higher,” says Abhishek Bhandari, Senior Research Analyst, Nomura.  He remains very cautious on the sectors citing uncertainty on revenues in the next fiscal years, despite a strong order book and execution by the Indian IT players.  In last one week,  Tanla Platforms  led the IT pack with a 18 per cent rise, followed by  Firstsource Solutions ,  Nazara Technologies  and  3I Infotech  rising between 10-12 per cent each.  Mid and smallcap IT counters including  Sonata Software ,  NIIT ,  RPSG Ventures ,  R Systems International ,  Sasken Technologies ,  Newgen Software Technologies  and  Mphasis  gained up to 8 per cent during the week.  Bluechip IT counters such as  Tech Mahindra  gained 7 per cent, whereas  Infosys  added 4 per cent.  TCS ,  HCL Tech  and  Wipro  also settled with mild gains.  On the contrary other analysts believe that some of the technology businesses are very attractively priced given their sound cash flows, management bandwidth and strength, along with share buybacks and strong dividend payouts.  All the spending is going into IT, whether it is in terms of digitalisation, cloud migration or Blockchain. These are strategic spends and not discretionary in nature, said Nitin Raheja, Executive Director, Head - Discretionary Equities, Julius Baer Wealth Advisors.  I really do not see how IT spends will come off. Yes, surely some of the so-called new age dotcom businesses will find funding difficult but for a lot of businesses, this spend is here to stay,\" said Raheja, who sees value in this underperforming sector.  Other market analysts suggest that investors should stick with larger IT companies with larger order books and stronger client relationships in pursuit of safety amid the rising fears of recessions.  The midcap names do have a very high growth rates and some of them are excellent and really very good companies but in this environment, it is safer to play and stick with the larger names, said Jonathan Schiessl, Deputy CIO, Westminster Asset Management  Clearly the whole group benefits from currency weakness of the Indian rupee and that is the positive side,\" he added. \"On the negative side, a global recession will impact their business.

Further, brokerage firm  Goldman Sachs  downgraded  Infosys ,  TCS  and  Tech Mahindra  to sell from buy citing slowdown in dollar revenue growth.  Among the top-10 contributors of the weakness in Sensex, five belong to the IT sector only. IT bluechips were trading with big cuts, dragging the indices lower in early trade.  Tata Consultancy Services  (TCS), Infosys,  HCL Technologies , Wipro and Tech Mahindra plunged 4-6 per cent each during early session, before making a partial recovery.

Despite a steep depreciation in rupee, pushing it to new lows, software exporters have remained out of favour.

At present, the valuations are comparatively better, but not compelling enough to take a serious interest for substantial investment, says Tejas  Khoday , CEO and co-founder of FYERS.  Another bout of correction, around 10 per cent, would make investors gravitate towards this sector once again,\" he adds.  I would rather buy the IT space because it has come down to attractive valuations. The past margin worries are nowhere,\" says independent market expert Mahantesh Sabarad.  The rising inflationary pressures and anticipation of aggressive rate hike from the US Fed does not bode well for the IT sector, which plunges in tandem to the US' tech barometer Nasdaq composite.  IT has been the worst performing sector in the last one month and six months the Nifty IT index dropped 6 per cent and 22 per cent, respectively during the periods.

Deepak Shenoy, Founder, Capital Mind said that it would not be a great time for IT companies even this quarter and the next, but from the March quarter onwards, till the next year when budgets are reallocated.  IT companies will do well and perhaps stock markets will typically lead this anticipation by about two or three months. This might be an interesting time to take IT on for the next five to six years as a cycle,\" he said.  Brokerage firm HDFC Securities believe that margins have bottomed in Q1, with medium-term tailwinds of normalisation in attrition/sub-con, utilisation and pricing.  Margin of safety is higher for tier-1s, whereas Mid-tier IT resilience is reflected in continued growth premium. \"We maintain a constructive stance on the sector,\" it added picking up Infosys from largecaps and Persistent Systems from midcap IT space.``   (Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views, and opinions given by the experts are their own.

Hence, the IT companies which export more to the European countries have faced high volatility due to the dual impact of rupee appreciation leading to lower value per order and lower demand due to clients postponing IT upgrades.

MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator and is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages. A nine-day exponential moving average, called the signal line, is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ opportunities.   When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal on the charts, indicating that the price of the security may experience an upward movement, and vice versa.   However, the MACD alone may not be enough to help take an investment call. Traders should make use of other indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci Series, candlestick patterns and stochastic to confirm any such trend.   Retail investors should consult a financial expert before buying or selling a stock based on such technical indicators.  The MACD charts also showed bearish crossovers on 11 counters on NSE, which analysts read as ‘sell’ signals. These counters included Mahindra Logistics, Accelya Kale, APL Apollo Tubes,  PI Industries ,  VIP Industries  and Manaksia Steels.

Going by the gap theory, a new leg of the rally in the upward direction should unfold now and Monday’s gap (10844 to 10815) may become a strong support zone. On the upside, the immediate hurdle is around 10,940 and we expect this to get surpassed, taking Nifty towards the 11,000 mark and above. Hence, one should keep trading with a positive bias as long as Nifty remains above the crucial swing low of 10749.”   Understanding MACD  Others    A close look at the chart of Vodafone Idea shows whenever the MACD line has crossed above the signal line, the stock has always shown an upward momentum and vice versa.

Where are We?  The Nifty closed almost flat for the month of December however the broader market participation was quite good and the market breadth was also in the favor of the bulls. The Banknifty, Midcap and Small cap Index outperformed the Nifty. The Nifty broadly consolidated in the range of 11,000-10,500 levels. In the month of January, the Nifty is likely to provide a breakout from the range, hence a 600 points move is likely from the last week’s closing this month.   What is in Store?  The Nifty has retraced 50per cent of the previous fall from 11,751-10,004 levels and if the Nifty provides a breakout on the upside — which is quite likely — then it will inch higher towards 11,050 first and thereafter 11,250-11,300 levels. Only if it breaks 10,530 levels will it then slide till 10,050 levels. The only concern for the bulls is that the monthly MACD is in sell mode.   What could Investors Do:  Since the possibility of wave C up is quite higher, we recommend staying long on the Index with a positional closing basis stop-loss below 10,530 levels for the targets of 11,050 and 11,250 levels. The risk to reward ratio is absolutely in favor of the bulls as the market is yet to complete its upward journey. Only, below 10,530 levels one should exit from all longs as below those levels it will quickly slide to 10,050 levels. Going forward Banknifty is likely to head towards 27,400-28,000 levels whereas the support for the same is pegged at 26,800 and 26,400 levels. The Mid-cap and Small-cap Indices are also expected to continue their upward journey as the retracement of the entire fall is still pending as these Indices are yet to test their 200DMA.

That amounted to a 283 basis points sequential rise and 958 basis points YoY expansion in margins.  Analysts said a reduction in domestic gas and global LNG prices helped the Gautam Adani-led company report healthy margins, and even pass on some of cost benefits to customers.  ICICI Securities  has a ‘buy’ rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 130.  Laurus Labs  is another. A superior product mix and lower tax rate helped the company report a 305 basis points expansion in March quarter margins at 13.12 per cent. This company had reported 10.07 per cent margin in December quarter and 6.79 per cent for March quarter of last year. This was the third straight quarterly margin improvement for the firm.  Motilal Oswal  Securities values the stock at 17 times forward 12-month multiples and has a price target of Rs 615.  Three cement makers -- Shree Cement,  Ambuja Cements  and ACC – also made the cut.  Shree Cement  saw the maximum sequential improvement in margin at 580 basis points (591 basis points YoY), followed by ACC at 255 basis points (41 basis points YoY) and Ambuja Cements at 177 basis points (171 basis points).  Cement prices rose across India in March quarter while input costs remained largely stable, helping cement makers to report better margins.  Mphasis,  Syngene International  and SBI Life were other three companies that managed to buck the weak margin trend. They reported 1.15-2.15 per cent sequential rise and up to 1,91 per cent year-on-year growth in March quarter margins.  For Mphasis, margins improved due to higher utilisation and rupee depreciation. This, in fact, helped the IT firm offset higher (selling, general & administrative) SG&A expenses.   In case of SBI Life, the margin improvement was led by rising share of protection and annuities. For Syngene, two main divisions, discovery and development services, contributed to margin expansion. "},

However, it has slashed its target price to Rs 1,085 from Rs 1,800, signalling about a 25 per cent rise in the counter from its previous close.  The brokerage believes that weakness in China's export prices will dent the company, leading to an EBITDA cut by 32-34 per cent on the back of lower realizations.  Tata Steel is trading at a P/B value of 0.8x, which is not below its mean of 0.7x. However, the stock may not hit 2020 levels of 0.5x, given the expectations of a stimulus from China.  Another global broking major, JP Morgan, remains overweight on  Vedanta  with a target price of Rs 499, expecting a 115 per cent rise in the counter from its previous close of Rs 232.25.  Vedanta has put its Tuticorin plant for sale lately after the backlash from locals over the violation of environmental norms. Following the update, shares of Vedanta plunged 12 per cent on Monday.  However, JP Morgan believes that the sale of the copper smelter would be a blessing in disguise for the company. \"LME aluminium prices are back to Q1FY22 levels, which is a big positive,\" it said.  Hong Kong-based brokerage CLSA is bullish on select pharma counters as it believes that Indian pharma firms with global footprints are set to gain.  Companies have expanded their product offering through both organic and inorganic routes,\" said CLSA. It sees a gradual margin expansion, leading to an improvement in return ratios.  It has initiated its coverage on  Gland Pharma , an injectable specialist, with a target price of Rs 3,450 per share, hinting at an upside of 35 per cent in the counter.  It has also initiated coverage on  Syngene International  with a buy rating and a target of Rs 710 on the stock. However, it has trimmed its target price on  Piramal Enterprises  to Rs 2,250 from Rs 2,330.   (Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

The week saw the  BSE  Sensex rallying 2,311 points or 4.29 per cent to 5,6072.23 while the NSE Nifty50 advanced 670.3 points or 4.17 per cent to 16,719. The broader BSE500 index also climbed 3.9 per cent to 22,828.47, thanks to a rebound in global indices, the resumption of FPI inflow and a decline in crude oil prices globally.  All sectors contributed to the surge wherein IT and metals, which were reeling under pressure till last week, witnessed a sharp rebound. Besides, the buoyancy in the banking space helped the key indices settle around the week’s high. Consequently, the broader indices too traded firm and gained in the range of 3.7-4.6 per cent,\" said Ajit Mishra of Religare Broking  The week saw 171 out of 500 BSE 500 stocks rising over 5 per cent; among them, 46 stocks gained over 10 per cent.

The $1.8 billion  UTI Equity Fund  managed by him has returned 26 per cent this year to be the top performer among Indian stock funds with at least $1 billion in assets. That’s versus a 13 per cent gain in the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex. Tyagi’s preference for buying shares in firms with high return on capital resulted in zero holdings in the metals and aviation sectors, which were the worst hit during the pandemic.  Now, as the global vaccine rollout is driving  value rotation  all around the world, boosting industrial and energy stocks, the 43-year old money manager maintains that he is not one to chase short-term returns.  “We haven’t discovered businesses in these sectors that have economic-value creation characteristics that we like,” he said in a phone interview. “When there are beta rallies, markets reward value companies, 90 per cent of which are nothing but trash.”  Bloomberg His philosophy is about buying good businesses and holding on to them. “Even in a once-in-decades episode like a pandemic, great businesses will emerge stronger by gaining market share from” weaker players, Tyagi said.  That strategy of sticking with quality has certainly paid off in 2020, which has seen the Sensex erasing more than a third of its value during the March meltdown and then surge relentlessly to break record highs. The UTI fund has outperformed the benchmark even as it didn’t hold  Reliance Industries Ltd.  -- India’s most valued stock and one that’s contributed a bulk of the Sensex’s 2020 gains.   IT, Pharma  Tyagi’s penchant for companies that use capital efficiently means the fund has had a large part of its holdings in information technology and pharmaceutical stocks. Those two are the best-performing sectors in India this year.  “I buy businesses that I define as high-quality ones, which have an ability to generate return on capital that is substantially higher than the cost of capital,” he said in a phone interview. “High ROC is also mathematically linked to high cash-flow generation. If you look at our portfolio over time, we have always been heavy on consumer, pharma, and IT.”  The fund’s allocation to financials -- a heavyweight sector -- is also about six percentage points below that of its benchmark Nifty 500 Index, according to its latest factsheet. That gauge has risen about 14 per cent this year.  “Capital allocation to every business is driven by longer-term outcomes in business rather than stock-price behavior,” Tyagi said. “We take no view about how stock prices will move in the near term because nobody has a clue about it.” "},

Such entities will be barred from having a representation on the board of another mutual fund house.

It gets more heft if finance comes into play.  Swati Kulkarni  of  UTI AMC  has done all that, and much much more.   She is a firm believer in timing it well. \"There's no rocket science in wealth creation, rather it's simple mathematics. The earlier you start, the more wealth you build,\" she tells you.  Her pet peeve? The executive vice-president with 27 years of professional experience hates to be recognised as the \"woman fund manager\" and is averse to taking any gender-specific query.  On  Women's Day , we profile one of the shining stars of the fund management industry where women are vastly outnumbered by men.    Early life  Kulkarni graduated in commerce and went on to earn her Masters in financial management from Narsee Monjee Institute of Management Studies of the University of Mumbai. A rank holder, she holds CFA charter conferred by CFA Institute, USA.  The long track record Kulkarni has a professional experience of a good 27 years, of which the last 26 years are with UTI AMC. She has been designated as a fund manager since 2004. Earlier, she was part of the fund management team involved in analysing companies across sectors and assisting fund managers. She has so far handled MF and market research, product reviews and quantitative analysis as part of the Research and Planning team at UTI.   A difficult call  On the ongoing fluctuations in the market, Kulkarni says, \"Whether it's the start of the bear market or not is very difficult to call, but we are moving to better delivery. If you look at the valuations, it was high because the underlying growth wasn't that great.\"   She is convinced that the pace of pick-up in earnings growth will be supportive of equities.   Worldwide, the market had a very low  volatility  in 2017, which is very unlike the equity market. Usually, the stock market is known to have greater volatility and greater risk. Last year, it was also the kind of synchronised growth in the world and there was a lot of liquidity. Now, the market is expecting three rate hikes by the Fed. If they hike rates more aggressively, it will shock the market further. Tightening of  liquidity  in the developed market and reduction in balance sheets have caused correction too,\" Kulkarni explains.   She is of the view that grandfathering could have cushioned the sudden shock of LTCG tax, but it has more to do with global cues.    Sectors that show promise  Banks and metals are going to play a bigger role in earnings revival for the next two years, according to Kulkarni.   The credit cost which we are seeing now and the asset quality recognition should be put behind us once we enter FY19 second half. So, banks will be a bigger supporter in FY19 and FY20 growth. Second could be metals as commodity prices have remained strong,\" she reasons.   No cakewalk for women  Kulkarni makes a point that fund management is a different ballgame in comparison to the typical procedural or process-driven job. In terms of active participation, one needs to be on their toes all the time as she is the constant decision maker in the team.   You need to stay updated as the world is very dynamic. There's randomness in the equity market and hence, many variables can affect the outcome,\" she cautions.  Hence, there is a significant number of women dropping out of workforce post marriage as the priorities change. Most of them have their locations changed and are not comfortable with long working hours, so on and so forth.    Force of compounding  Start saving early, says Kulkarni, because the wider your investment horizon, the greater your wealth.   Kulkarni backs up: \"It doesn't take much to start saving on a monthly basis... it's just the question of some control over your monthly expenditure.  She illustrates her point. \"If putting some curbs on your expenditure, you can easily carve out a small amount and that could help in a big way in terms of accumulating wealth over a period of time. If you save Rs 5,000 per month, in 20 years, it will be close to Rs 38 lakh and you will build Rs 66 lakh for 25 years. It's simple mathematics... the earlier you start, the more wealth you create,\" Kulkarni adds. "},

SEBI regulations stipulate that no sponsor of a  mutual fund  can own 10 per cent or more of any other mutual fund or have representation on the board of the asset management company or the trustee company of any other mutual fund - and must be in compliance with this regulation by March 13, 2019.  “The UTI AMC directors nominated by certain conflicted shareholders have gone well outside the bounds of good governance and essentially taken control of the UTI AMC Board, including defying the lawfully binding direction of the independent mutual fund Trustee Board. In doing so, they have created conditions that prevent timely compliance with the SEBI regulation requiring each of them to sell below 10 per cent,” the spokesperson for T Rowe Price said.  “This lack of timely action by the Indian authorities and the willful disregard for the law and regulations by the conflicted UTI shareholders and the supposedly independent directors is jeopardising UTI while also sending a very negative message to foreign investors about India’s attractiveness as an investment destination.” "},

The regulator also wants their nominees removed from the boards of  UTI AMC  and UTI Trustee Co before December 31, 2020. If they don’t comply, the shareholding and voting rights of the three in excess of 9.99% would be frozen, it said. The regulator has asked the three shareholders to submit a compliance report within one month. Sebi said it may initiate adjudication proceedings against them for not following the rules. LIC, SBI and BoB didn’t respond to queries.  Sebi had introduced crossholding limits in  mutual funds  in March 2018 to eliminate potential conflicts of interest. It mandated that if a shareholder has at least a 10% interest in a mutual fund, it cannot hold a similar-sized stake in another fund house and would also have to give up its board positions.  “It is noted that despite the expiry of over 20 months from the date of amendment of the regulations, the noticees (LIC, SBI, BoB) are yet to achieve compliance with these requirements,” Sebi wholetime member G Mahalingam said in his order, which was posted on the website on Friday.  “While the noticees have shown that they have initiated some steps to dilute their stake in UTI AMC, the substantial compliance with Regulation 7B still remains pending,” the order said.  Compliance with rule was critical, the regulator said.  “This conflict of interest could affect the functioning and performance of the mutual fund industry as a whole,” Sebi said. “Thus, implementation of Regulation 7B is critical to the removal of such potential conflict of interest for improving the overall functioning of the mutual fund industry and to foster the interest of investors.”  Sebi said the three shareholders have not indicated any specific road map or timeline for diluting their holding.  As per UTI AMC shareholder agreement of November 7, 2009, those holding more than 10% stake are entitled to nominate, appoint or recommend directors in proportion to their holding. UTI’s four domestic shareholders — LIC, SBI,  Punjab National Bank  (PNB) and BoB — hold an 18.5% stake each. All except PNB have their own AMCs. US asset manager T Rowe Price holds the remaining 26% stake.  “There has been considerable delay on the part of the noticees (LIC, SBI and BoB) in putting forth a concrete plan for divestment to DIPAM (Department of Investment and Public Asset management) and seeking its approval thereon,” Mahalingam said. “While Regulation 7B was inserted in MF Regulations on March 13, 2018, providing one year time limit for its compliance, concurrence for divesting stakes in UTI AMC was sought by the noticees from DIPAM only in January 2019.”  All three shareholders had told Sebi they need prior approval of the government to transfer their shares in UTI AMC, which they got in two stages this year — initial approval on April 9 and a revised one on September 12.  “Even after the receipt of the initial approval, I note that the compliance got further delayed for various reasons including lack of consensus amongst the major shareholders for the divestment plan,” he said. “On a perusal of the correspondence available on records, I feel that a more proactive approach from the noticees would have certainly expedited the compliance.”  In April, DIPAM had approved divestment of stake in UTI AMC by shareholders in two phases — 25% offloading of stake by all institutional shareholders on a prorata basis and 10.92% divestment in the second phase by way of a follow-on public offer (FPO).  T Rowe Price didn’t agree with this and a revised divestment plan providing for stake reduction of 8.25% stake each by LIC, SBI and BoB and 3% each by T Rowe Price and PNB at one go by way of IPO was approved by DIPAM.

", "article": "UTI Asset Management Company  (AMC) has come under the capital markets regulator’s scanner for allegedly violating  investment  regulations, said two people with the direct knowledge of the development.  Securities and Exchange Board of India ( Sebi ) is investigating whether some investments of UTI’s  India Debt Opportunities Fund  (IDOF) — registered as a foreign portfolio investor( FPI ) — were in contravention with overseas fund rules. The regulator has sent a showcause notice on the matter to UTI to which the fund house has responded, said one of the two people.  The regulator’s probe showed the UTI fund had purchased government securities at a time when the foreign limits applicable were fully utilised. UTI had also made incorrect statements with depositories to obtain a category II FPI licence, said one of the person’s cited above.  The asset manager is gearing up for an initial public offering (IPO) and has filed an offer document with Sebi last week. “UTI received a showcause notice from Sebi in October, and has replied to it. The matter is pending with the adjudication officer of Sebi,” said a person cited above. Emails sent to Sebi and UTI went unanswered.  India Debt Opportunities Fund is managed by UTI International – a subsidiary of UTI AMC and is registered as category II FPI with Sebi. The FPI license was given by Sebi on the grounds that India Debt Opportunities Fund was a broad-based fund, which must have at least 20 investors. Investigation by Sebi showed the statements given by UTI to depositories were incorrect and the fund didn’t fulfil the broad-basing criteria.  The main allegation against UTI is violation of debt investment norms. FPI investments in government securities are subject to annual limits and debt papers can only be purchased through auction route. Mostly, debt limits for FPIs in government securities remain fully utilised for foreign investors. UTI IDOF buying government papers even when applicable limits were fully utilised has caused notional loss to the Centre, according to the show cause notice issued by Sebi.“Investments by IDOF through IDOF Scheme in government securities were made without purchasing debt limits under the auction route, in contravention of circulars issued by Sebi and Sebi FPI Regulations, allegedly causing a notional loss of Rs 244.34 million to the government of India,” UTI disclosed in a red herring prospectus submitted to Sebi last week.  Some of IDOF investments were based on Sebi’s  mutual fund  norms whereas the fund was expected to follow FPI norms, said one of the two people in the know. “The key point remains whether these are mere technical violations or not,” the person said. “If they are, UTI will be able to settle the case or get away with minimum fine.” "},

Shares of Nippon Life Asset Management gained 9 per cent to close at Rs 309.10 on Tuesday while those of HDFC AMC ended up 2 per cent at Rs 2,508.60.  Analysts said the penetration of domestic mutual fund industry is low and there is a steady shift of household savings towards financial assets. With more players listing, there is likely to be more interest in the sector although the current listed players are trading at rich valuations, said analysts.  “They are overvalued no doubt and Sebi has been capping the TERs (Total Expense Ratio) of mutual funds, which has a negative effect on asset management companies, and it becomes more of a volume game. However, whenever there is a new listing, especially when there are very few listed players, automatically interest in the sector perks up,” said independent analyst Ambareesh Baliga.

Since expert hands operate here, the valuations given to the stocks used to be true reflection of the businesses.  That space has ceased to be so, thanks to the influx of a host of  HNIs  and a few  institutional investors , trying to catch companies young. As shares are in short supply, this rising demand has inflated prices, which do not hold after the company goes public and that leaves some investors trapped.  What’s more, market watchers point out that a few financial intermediaries are going around selling unlisted stocks to unsuspecting and inexperienced small investors, thereby leaving in a sure shot trap.  They can easily figure out the number of shares available in the off-market from annual reports and trigger the price. This leads to malpractices in the business. Such tactics trap retail investors, who enter at astronomical and far-fetched valuations.

Dealers in the unlisted markets attribute this to herd behaviour among investor, valuation bubble, fragile fundamentals of the businesses and also lack of opportunities in a liquidity-flooded market.  “There is a wide gap between demand and supply (in the grey market). Supply of shares is limited, whereas the demand is unlimited,” said Dinesh Gupta, Co-founder, UnlistedZone. \"Earlier, shares used to trade at a decent discount, but the spike in demand over the years has evaporated all those discounts. Now, unlisted shares are demanding hefty premia.  Shares of Suryoday Small Finance Bank were trading at Rs 320 prior to its  IPO . However, the stock now trades below Rs 240 two months after its listing.  UTI AMC  was trading at Rs 900-950 before the IPO. The company raised primary capital at Rs 554. The stock now trades at Rs 775 six months after listing.  The recently relisted shares of  Coffee Day Enterprises  are available at just Rs 25, half the price they used to command in the unofficial market prior to listing. Another relisted candidate, SMC Global, had surged to Rs 95, but now one can buy it at Rs 70 post listing.  The unlisted market used to be a pure play of value buying, which has lost its charm. It is not plain vanilla. Very much like secondary market, the market is left with limited number of promising players,” said Sandip Ginodia, CEO of Kolkata-based Altius Investech  Now valuations have shot up rapidly, which makes the market more price-sensitive. Investors must have a long-term horizon to witness growth of business, but everyone is keen on making a quick buck,” he said.  Barbeque Nation Hospitality was trading at Rs 550 in off-market deals, but is now marginally up at Rs 625. MSTC and CSB Bank are some other notable examples that failed to reward investors, despite the buzz in the unlisted market.  However, Rakesh Jhunjhunwala-backed  Nazara Technologies  has bucked the trend, delivering up to 85 per cent return to investors since listing.  Many of these shares had been sold to insiders as ESOPs, which then found their way to the unlisted market. The lack of a real, fair and open price discovery adds to the woes.  Gupta of UnlistedZone compares the current situation of the unlisted market to exit polls in elections. He said just like poll results are estimated on the basis of data from a limited sample size of total population, similarly, investors end up overvaluing a company as the free float in the pre-IPO market is very limited.  On the flip side, raising capital privately from a small group of people is a legitimate and important part of the financing business. Angel investing and venture funding are but special cases of such share sales. There’s nothing wrong with owners of such stocks selling them off to others privately.  However, investors are neglecting the sky-high and lofty valuations and are willing to pay unjustified premium. For instance, Reliance Retail is trading at an absurd market-cap of Rs 9-9.5 lakh crore, compared with Rs 12.5 lakh crore for Reliance Industries.  “Big players with deep pockets have entered the market, but there is limited depth to absorb money. So they are willing to pay much higher prices than the intrinsic valuation,” Sandip Ginodia, CEO of Kolkata-based Altius Investech said.  He said the entry of wealthy investors and big ticket-sized large alternative investment funds (AIFs) has hampered the process of wealth creation in unlisted markets. The scarcity premium is reaching bizare levels.  Devendra Agrawal, Founder & CEO, Dexter Capital Advisors said the pre-IPO market has been a puzzle for many novice investors. Institutions buy stakes in top-notch nascent businesses but HNIs and retail investors are now rushing to this space, chasing the trend or buzz, thus pushing up prices.  “Not all the companies from this space are backed by robust fundamentals, unable to sustain premium pricing,\" he said. “Investors must be cautious and bet on quality companies at fair prices with decent growth opportunities.” "},

Although both mutual funds and direct equity investments are suited for different money goals and risk appetite, yet the fate of investors in AMC stocks and mutual fund investors are closely interlinked.  Out of the 44 asset management companies (AMCs) in India, the top 10 control around 80 per cent of the assets under management (AUM). Only three are listed so far – HDFC AMC, Nippon Life India AMC and UTI AMC.   ICICI Securities, which had initiated ‘buy’ calls on all the three AMC stocks earlier this year, said a strong double-digit growth outlook driven by under-penetration, nil capex requirement, high operating leverage and supernormal RoEs make the Indian asset management industry a very attractive business proposition.  We expect the theme of financialisation of savings to continue hereon due to lower returns offered by other asset classes such as bank FDs and real estate. Our macro model suggests that Indian MF AUM is expected to grow at 15% CAGR between FY20 and FY30. Well-established business franchises with entrenched distribution, healthy AUM share and strong brand equity will capture these business opportunities,\" the brokerage said in a report.

In the last one month, HDFC AMC is up 9 per cent, Nippon Life India AMC 9.8 per cent and UTI AMC 12 per cent.  Boasting of a strong bank-backed distribution network and brand value, several analysts say HDFC AMC, which is India's largest mutual fund house, could be the best among the lot. The stock commands a premium valuation of 49 times its current earnings.  Analysts at JM Financial Institutional Securities believe that UTI AMC is trading at an undemanding valuation and at a discount to its peers. The brokerage has a target price of Rs 900 on the stock, an upside of 16 per cent.  YES Securities, which is bullish on all the three stocks, sees Nippon India AMC shares going up to Rs 452 level, an upside of 24 per cent.  Growing steadily at a CAGR of 19 per cent over the last 20 years, the mutual fund industry's assets under management (AUM) has witnessed a two-fold rise over the last five years.  Data from Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI) shows that during the last 12 months, the mutual fund industry witnessed outflows in 5 months. In May 2021 alone, the overall net outflows stood at Rs 38,602 crore as compared with a net inflow of Rs 70,813 crore in May 2020. Assets under management (AUMs) of the mutual fund industry, however, reached Rs 33.1 lakh crore on the back of rising equity market.  During the last 12 months, equity-oriented mutual fund schemes have seen total outflows of Rs 18,659 crore as investors chose to book profits in a soaring market. In the last 3 months, however, the trend has reversed. Equity funds have seen inflows but investors have pulled out money from debt funds.  The penetration i.e. AUM as a percentage of GDP remains merely at ~12% compared to the USA (120%) or Canada (81%). The banking sector still dominates the household savings portfolio in India with over 56% share, whereas the share of the mutual funds industry is just 6.7% (September 2020). It is still Day 1 for India,\" Flipkart co-founder Sachin Bansal said in a LinkedIn post. Harbouring big ambitions in the BFSI space, his company Navi Technologies recently acquired Essel Mutual Fund and renamed it Navi Mutual Fund.  Competition in the mutual fund space is set to get murkier as biggies like discount broker Zerodha, NBFC Bajaj Finserv, Samir Arora's Helios Capital Management and Rakesh Jhunjhunwala's Alchemy Capital have applied for licenses from Sebi.  Whether it is through index funds, ETFs or actively managed funds, if mutual fund investors are to become richer, chances are high that AMC stock investors won't be far behind.  "},

In October 2020, the lender had sold its 3% stake in UTI AMC for around 180 crore.  PNB intends to divest its stake in Canara HSBC OBC Life Insurance within the regulatory guidelines to monetise it, said Rao. He said the bank is looking to divest stake in asset reconstruction companies during 2022-23.  With regard to real estate assets, Rao said, the bank has one of the floors in Bhikaji Cama Place at Delhi and other floors are in line.  PNB expects recovery of about 5,000 from both National Company Law Tribunal and non-NCLT cases in the January-March period. “At a conservative level we are confident of getting gross non-performing assets (NPAs) below 12% by March 2022.

The bank on Thursday reported a two-fold jump in standalone net profit to Rs 1,126.78 crore for the third quarter ended December 2021 as bad loans marginally declined. "},

By this year-end, the domestic bourses are unlikely to witness fresh highs and a strong bout of profit booking may emerge instead.", "article": "The  domestic equity market  corrected sharply midway through the week gone by on renewed fear of a spike in Covid-19 cases and fresh restrictions in some of the advanced countries.  With the US Election Day just three weeks away, global markets have also slipped into a wait-and-watch mode. Both political parties in the US have substantive but diametrically opposite ideologies and policies to run economic affairs, which the markets are waiting to discount.  In any case, there are fears that the election this time around may bring with it a prolonged litigation over the balloting system. And this will eventually delay the second round of stimulus, further postponing the next wave of liquidity which may negatively impact global markets.  Indian markets too might witness profit booking in the near term, and move sideways. By this year-end, the domestic bourses are unlikely to witness fresh highs and a strong bout of profit booking may emerge instead. If this line of events turns out to be true, it will throw up good buying opportunity for  investors , who are patiently waiting to accumulate quality stocks after a healthy correction.  More so, the buzz around IPOs now seems to be fizzling out, since the listing of two much-hyped IPOs –  UTI AMC  and  Mazagon Docks  – turned out to be tepid. This  dented market sentiment , which turned neutral from bullish. Given the further deterioration in global macros and micros, the sentiment can now turn bearish till the beginning of the New Year.

All these factors do not bode well for the domestic market.   Event of the Week  The government tried incentivize consumer spending to prop up lacklustre economic conditions through a slew of measures before the festive season. The government unveiled an LTC concession scheme and other sops for a large army of government employees to stimulate consumer spending.  Whether this petty booster will move the consumerism needle or not will have to be seen, but unfortunately the booster is being seen to be quite small and negligible compared with the mammoth size of the economy. And this may not strike the right chord in the market as a sentiment booster.    Technical Outlook  Nifty50 posted another big bearish candle during the week, which indicated that the bulls have become tired and are unable to lift the index further. The non-stop market rally for more than 10 days can be attributed to the highly optimistic herd behaviour, as majority of the participants were on the long side and hardly anyone was left to be long.  So, the market moved in only one direction as there was no buyer left which it was down. An additional boost from the global indices reflecting fears of a second wave of lockdowns turned out to be another negative trigger. However, we are still trading within the rising channel on the weekly chart, and need a close below the channel support to confirm the end of the bullish trend.   ET CONTRIBUTORS  Traders are advised to maintain a cautious outlook going forward and be watchful of the market’s reaction to the channel support. Support and resistance levels in the short term are placed at 11,300 and 11,900 levels.   Expectations for the Week  The market will be looking at important earnings in the coming week from bellwethers such as HDFC Life, Avenue Supermarts, Britannia and HUL, to name a few. The earnings numbers and management commentaries will guide market participants on the pace of recovery in the formal economy after the easing of restrictions. Select pockets – especially hotels, travel and tourism – are yet to recover because of their inherent disadvantages in being able to operate amid lockdowns, and hence, their earnings are expected to be muted. But as stock prices have already rallied in the recent past, selling pressure is likely to emerge in these sectors.  The market may also witness a sectoral rotation and is likely to remain rangebound. Profit booking may emerge on some counters at higher levels. Overbought stocks should be avoided completely and oversold ones can be considered for an upside over the medium term.  Investors are advised to remain patient and wait for a serious correction before investing in this market. Nifty50 closed the week at 11,762, down 1.3 per cent.  "},

If the deal goes through and Tata  AMC  and  UTI AMC  are eventually merged, the combined entity would be the fourth largest asset manager in India - after  SBI  AMC,  ICICI Prudential  AMC, and  HDFC AMC .   As of June 30, assets under management (AUM) of UTI AMC and Tata AMC were ₹2.24 lakh crore and ₹88,367 crore, respectively.

Tata Sons and  Tata Investment Corporation  own 68% and 32% stakes, respectively, in Tata AMC.     A Bid to Scale up Quickly   To be sure, it is not clear yet whether the Tata Group will merge the two AMCs. UTI AMC also has another significant shareholder. UTI AMC, which was carved out of the erstwhile Unit Trust of India (UTI) in 2003, has no promoters but sponsors such as LIC, PNB, SBI, and BOB. The other big  investor  in the AMC is T Rowe Price Group Inc which, through its wholly owned subsidiary T Rowe Price International, held a 22.97% stake as on June 30, 2022.   Mailed queries to Tata AMC, LIC, SBI, PNB, and BOB remained unanswered till press time.  Top officials close to the Tatas said the current asset management business of the group is small and like all other businesses, the view taken is that if it has to be a significant player in the segment, it has to scale up. \"And that means the M&A route is the only way to quickly scale up,\" said one of the people cited above.   For the year ended March 31, 2022, UTI AMC posted a net profit of Rs 534 crore on revenue of Rs 1,319 crore. Tata AMC has reported revenue of Rs 342 crore and a net profit of Rs 103 crore in FY22.   Earlier this year, PNB said it wants to monetise its non-core assets, and that includes selling its stake in UTI AMC. In October 2020, the lender sold its 3% stake in UTI AMC for around Rs 180 crore, bringing down ownership to 15.22%.   In December 2019, market regulator the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) directed LIC, SBI and BOB to reduce their stakes in UTI AMC by December 2020. These three public sector financial institutions held 18.24% each back then, while Sebi's cross-holding norms for  mutual funds  do not allow the sponsor of one AMC to hold more than 10% in another. Subsequently, these three firms reduced their stakes below 10% during the IPO in October 2020.   The latest M&A deal in the Rs 38-lakh crore mutual fund industry was by a consortium comprising Bandhan Financial Holdings Limited,  GIC , and ChrysCapital, which acquired  IDFC  Mutual Fund for Rs 4,500 crore. In December last year, HSBC AMC acquired L&T Investment Management (LTIM) for about Rs 3,200 crore. Similarly, Baroda Asset Management was recently merged with  BNP Paribas  Asset Management India.  In a smaller deal,  Sundaram  AMC acquired the assets of Principal Asset Management for about Rs 340 crore last year.   Currently, SBI Mutual Fund is the largest AMC in India in terms of AUM of Rs 6.47 lakh crore, followed by ICICI Prudential and  HDFC  Mutual Fund with Rs 4.65 lakh crore and Rs 4.15 Lakh crore, respectively.

In November, the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) has set aside a Sebi order that banned Rajan from the capital markets for alleged insider trading.  In July 2014, Sebi had barred Rajan after finding him guilty of  trading  in shares on the basis of unpublished price sensitive information. The regulator had also directed him to disgorge an amount of Rs 1.09 crore, which was already deposited by him in an escrow account. Earlier, Sebi was of the view that Rajan had traded on the basis of unpublished price sensitive information pertaining to cancellation of two shareholders agreement of  Gammon Infra  with Simplex Infrastructure.   According to SAT, the information in itself was not price sensitive.  “Considering the minor proportion of the transaction to the turnover of GIPL (Gammon Infra), in our view the information cannot be termed as price sensitive information. Simplex had not even disclosed the said information to the stock exchanges,\" the tribunal had said.  The tribunal had said that even if it is assumed that the information is price sensitive, \"still the appellant cannot be blamed of insider trading for the reasons that he did not trade on the basis of the information\".  The tribunal had noted that Rajan was able to show that he needed the money that he garnered from sale of shares for infusing capital in one of his firms that was undergoing a corporate debt restructuring (CDR) during the time. Besides, he even sold his agricultural land and flat in the same period. "},

India's iron ore exports stood at 15.3 MT in FY22, while that of iron ore pellets stood at 11 MT.

Export duty on iron ore has been increased to 50% across all grades from 30% for lumps, while that on pellets has been imposed at 45% from nil earlier, making exports unviable. Further, the government has imposed a 15% export duty on hot-rolled, and cold-rolled steel products from nil earlier.  On the import front, the government has cut import duty on some raw materials like PCI and coking coal to nil from 2.5%, while on met coal and coke and semi-coke from 5% to zero.  Domestic steel companies will have to bear the 15% export duty as export contracts are mostly fixed. Also, as demand in the exports market has turned weak, this will further aggravate the pressure,\" said Kamlesh Bagmar, deputy head of research, Prabhudas Lilladher. \"Lower import duty on inputs could increase the margins, but the benefit will not be immediate as companies carry an inventory of 1-1.5 months.

On the domestic front, the earnings season has also not been very encouraging so far, further adding to the pressure.  We expect volatility to remain high due to the scheduled derivatives expiry of July series.

So what is fuelling the interest in the company?  There is no clear answer to this question. The stock is not tracked by any analyst. They usually refrain from talking about such stocks.   A mail sent to the company bounced and no one answered the phone at its Delhi office.   A deep dive into the trade data shows that for most days, the  trading volume  remains very low — in the range of hundreds to a few thousand shares per day. In the last 30 sessions, the number of trades or transactions on the BSE went past 100 on only three occasions.  This is symptomatic of classic pump-and-dump schemes or price manipulation by a few traders to attract gullible retail investors. But this is extremely difficult to verify.   The stock is classified under the T group on BSE, meaning its shares are not allowed to be traded on an intra-day basis as a surveillance measure. Hence, the counter sees 100 per cent delivery trades.   Shareholding The company’s latest annual report counts Cresta Fund, Albula Investment Fund and APMS Investment Fund as three of the top non-promoter shareholders in the company. These institutional investors were under a cloud recently due to their investment in Adani Group firms. Apart from them, Pinewood Strategy and LIC of India are the other major shareholders in the company, the annual report states.   The June quarter shareholding data shows that high net-worth investors hold a little less than 28 per cent stake in the company. Retail investors hold 1.31 per cent as of June, compared with 0.9 per cent at the end of March. Overall, public shareholders own a 36.98 per cent stake.  "},

However, stocks of  Mahanagar Gas ,  Gujarat Gas  and  Indraprastha Gas  fell as much as 4 per cent.  Prices of natural gas on Friday were hiked by a steep 40 per cent to record levels, in step with the global firming up of energy rates. The rate paid for gas produced from old fields, which make up for about two-thirds of all gas produced in the country, was hiked to $8.57 per million British thermal units from the current $6.1, according to an order from the Oil Ministry's Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell (PPAC).

On Friday, the government raised domestic gas prices by over 40% to $8.57 per mBtu for the October-March period.  The hike in prices is higher than what Kotak Equities had expected, and it believes this will lift ONGC’s earnings by about 16%.  A $2 mBtu higher gas price will lift RIL’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization or EBITDA for the exploration and production business by nearly Rs 3,700 crores in 2023-24 (April-March), the brokerage said.  Although the hike is positive, Kotak Equities believes such a higher price is not sustainable and therefore limits the benefits for producers. Besides, the government could take away part of this benefit by imposing an additional windfall gains tax, the brokerage said.    CITY GAS DISTRIBUTORS For these companies, the price hike will hurt the earnings as this will increase costs. In rupee terms, domestic gas prices are up by nearly 3.5 times since September 2021.  For every $1/mBtu gas price rise, city gas distributors need to raise compressed natural gas prices by Rs 4.7-4.9/kg. Based on the current hike, these companies will need an immediate increase of Rs 12-14/kg in the CNG price, said Kotak Equities.  “In our view, just as a distributor gas, CGDs cannot absorb gas price increases,” it said.  Given limited leeway to pass through the entire hike in prices, analysts expect the margins of these companies to remain under pressure.   However, Kotak Equities retained its positive view on the city gas distributors and is of the view that any near-term weakness in the stock would be an opportunity to buy. It has retained a “buy” rating on both  Indraprastha Gas  and  Mahanagar Gas . "},

The government of India has extended the suspension period of Countervailing Duty (CVD) from China by another five months beyond September 30, 2021.  “These decisions have dealt a blow to the domestic industry, which has witnessed an import surge of 115 per cent during the April’21- September’21 period on a YoY basis.

Data showed 16 stocks were showing bearish trends on the MACD. They included Tata Consumer Products, Happiest Minds, Torrrent Pharma,  VIP Industries , KNR Constructions and Coforge, among others.   Tala Elxsi, Power Finance Corp, Shalby, Syngene International and Relxo Foorwears also showed bearish undertone.   ETMarkets.com  The  MACD indicator  should not be seen in isolation, as it may not be sufficient to take a trading call based on it, just the way a fundamental analyst cannot give a ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ recommendation using a single valuation ratio.  This is because the MACD is a trend-following indicator. Though traders can increase the sensitivity of MACD by using shorter moving averages to compute MACD (e.g. 5-day and 12-day moving averages), the lag effect will still be there. Hence, one should also look at other indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci Series, candlestick patterns, and Stochastic to confirm an emerging trend.

Asian markets were all up in the early trade. India was no exception.  At 9.20 am, the BSE  Sensex  was trading 581.26 points or 0.99 per cent higher at 59,398.55.  Nifty50  was trading at 17,692.65, up 158 points or 0.90 per cent. The index breached the 17,700 mark in early trade. The midcap and smallcap indices edged up to 0.8 per cent higher.

UltraTech Cement  was the sole Sensex loser, edging 0.10 per cent lower.   The annual US consumer price index eased to 8.5 per cent in July from a 40-year high of 9.1 per cent the previous month, the US Labor Department reported, while the monthly rate was unchanged, which was a big surprise.  A large part of the deceleration came from volatile energy prices, including a 7.7 per cent MoM decline in retail gasoline prices. However, relative to our expectations, the downside surprise was driven by weaker-than-expected rent-related components. That said, rent inflation remained elevated by historical standards, suggesting underlying trend inflationary pressures remained firm,\" Nomura said on US inflation print.  V K Vijayakumar of  Geojit Financial Services  said the inflation data at 8.5 per cent in July will be a near-term boost to markets. \"Many believe that the peaks of inflation and Fed hawkishness are behind us. The next Fed rate hike is, therefore, likely to be 50 bp and not 75 bp. This also increases the probability of a soft landing in the US. The near-term texture of the market is likely to be bullish. But this need not sustain for two reasons. One, market valuations are high and this will attract profit booking. Two, details of the US inflation data reveals that inflation is unlikely to drift down steadily since wage growth and rents continue to rise.  Most Asian markets were trading higher. The decline in dollar index to below 106 is supportive of more capital flows to emerging markets and India is the outperformer in the EM universe, Vijayakumar said. Provisional data showed foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) turned buyers of domestic stocks to the tune of Rs 1,061.88 crore on Wednesday.  Also supporting stocks was a fall in oil prices. Brent crude futures fell by 53 cents, or 0.5 per cent, to $96.87 a barrel, while US West Texas Intermediate crude futures fell 61 cents, or 0.7 per cent, to $91.32.

While the Sensex ended 337 points lower, the Nifty declined 0.5% to end the weekly expiry day above 17,600, while broader markets outperformed the headline indices.  Here's how analysts read the market pulse:  Siddhartha Khemka, Head - Retail Research,  Motilal Oswal Financial Services , said: “Indian markets again showed resilience in the face of global weakness after the US Fed sounded more hawkish in its future action. Nifty opened a gap down but attempted to recover twice during the day, to finally close with a loss of 86 points at 17,630”.  Amit Trivedi, CMT, Technical Analyst - Institutional Equities, Yes Securities, said: “Since past four sessions, Nifty’s range has been confined within the high/low range of large bearish (i.e. 17,820-17,497) candle, formed on 16th September; inability to sustain above 17,820 stalled upside momentum, while on the slip side levels of 17,500 acting as immediate floor.”  That said, here’s a look at what some key indicators are suggesting for Friday’s action:   Wall Street  opens lower Wall Street stocks fell early Thursday, extending a retreat as more central banks joined the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates in response to soaring inflation. About 20 minutes into trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.5 percent at 30,042.90.  The broad-based S&P 500 shed 0.6 percent to 3,765.54, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index dropped 1.0 percent to 11,112.34.   European markets slide European shares fell on Thursday, with tech stocks sliding after the U.S. Federal Reserve delivered another jumbo-sized interest rate hike and signalled more increases in its fight against stubbornly high inflation. The Bank of England raised its key interest rate to 2.25% from 1.75%.  The pan-European STOXX 600 index shed 1% by late afternoon trade while rate-sensitive European tech stocks were down 1.6% and banks up 0.4%.   Tech View: Small-bodied candle on daily charts Nifty formed a small-bodied candle on the daily charts. \"The Nifty remained volatile during the day as the market participants adjusted positions according to the FOMC outcome. On the daily chart, Nifty formed a small-bodied candle with wicks on both sides, suggesting indecisiveness,” Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at  LKP Securities , said.   Stocks showing bullish bias Momentum indicator Moving Average Convergence Divergence ( MACD ) showed a bullish trade setup on the counters of NHPC,  KPIT Technologies , NMDC,  Devyani International  and  Bombay Dyeing , among others.  The MACD is known for signaling trend reversals in traded securities or indices. When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement and vice versa.   Stocks signalling weakness ahead The MACD showed bearish signs on the counters of  Fortis Healthcare , Power Grid, Vedanta, Ujjivan Small Finance and Apollo Tyres. A bearish crossover on the MACD on these counters indicated that they had just begun their downward journey.   Most active stocks in value terms Ambuja Cements  (Rs 1,323 crore),  Adani Enterprises  (Rs 1,288 crore), Infosys (Rs 1,257 crore), RIL (Rs 1,184 crore) and Fortis Healthcare (Rs 1,165 crore) were among the most active stocks on NSE in value terms. Higher activity on a counter in value terms can help identify the counters with the highest trading turnovers in the day.   Most active stocks in volume terms Suzlon Energy  (Shares traded: 32.51 crore),  Vodafone Idea  (Shares traded: 10.21 crore), Yes Bank (Shares traded: 9.95 crore), JP Power (Shares traded: 9.6 crore) and  Shree Renuka Sugars  (Shares traded: 9.91 crore) were among the most traded stocks in the session on NSE.   Stocks showing buying interest Shares of Campus Activewear,  Varun Beverages ,  Page Industries , Welspun Corp and  Lakshmi Machine  witnessed strong buying interest from market participants as they scaled their fresh 52-week highs, signalling bullish sentiment.   Stocks seeing selling pressure Shares of  Sona BLW Precision , MedPlus Health, Finolex, Zensar and Indian Oil were among those that witnessed strong selling pressure and hit their 52-week lows, signalling bearish sentiment on the counters.

In comparison, total tax collected (centre’s share) is estimated at Rs 20 trillion; the fertilizer subsidy is not small. Yes, the Russia-Ukraine crisis disrupted ammonia and potash supplies, but the subsidy amount has steadily risen over the past two decades.", "article": "Last week, the G-7, a group of seven wealthy nations (US, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, the UK, and Japan), announced that it would cap the prices of Russian oil exports at a level “based on a range of technical inputs”. The intention is noble: the price cap is designed to reduce Russia’s ability to fund the ongoing crisis with Ukraine and reduce inflation in  G-7  countries at the same time.  In theory, it sounds good; in practice, there are many problems.  One, the leverage that G-7 has on this issue is rather weak. Importers seeking insurance cover and shipping services from companies based in G-7 and EU countries would need to observe the price ceiling. It might be cheaper for buyers to switch insurance and shipping suppliers rather than give up the cheap oil.  Second, large incremental Russian oil importers (China and India) might not agree to the price caps citing national interest. And the worst is, if successful, this decision will take Russian oil out of the market, pushing oil prices even higher. It may not be a problem for self-sufficient oil consumers (like the US), but for other countries in G-7, it would increase inflation instead of reducing it.  Russia chided the proposal as ‘absurd’ and threatened to stop selling oil to any country that participated in the proposal. The same day, Gazprom suspended operations of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline indefinitely, exacerbating the squeeze on the bloc’s gas supplies ahead of winter. As the aphorism goes, “the road to hell is paved with good intentions”.  Over the years, in India, we have built many such roads. In a bid to support the Green Revolution of the early 1970s, we created a system to offer cheap electricity and fertilizer to farmers. Both topics are large enough to warrant a separate discussion; today, let us look at fertilizers.  India’s fertilizer subsidy bill this year will top Rs 2.5 trillion. In comparison, total tax collected (centre’s share) is estimated at Rs 20 trillion; the fertilizer subsidy is not small. Yes, the  Russia-Ukraine crisis  disrupted ammonia and potash supplies, but the subsidy amount has steadily risen over the past two decades. How did we get here?  Before 1961, India produced only simple nitrogenous fertilizers (like ammonium sulphate and urea), and the production of complex fertilizers (NPK complex) began only later. The Indian government passed the Fertilizer Control Order in 1957 to regulate its sale and pricing. The first fertilizer subsidy scheme was introduced in 1977 and underwent various iterations later on.  Today, the fertilizer subsidy is implemented in two major formats: Urea is sold at a fixed price, and the difference between cost and selling price is reimbursed to the manufacturer or importer, and nutrient-based subsidy (for P&K or complex fertilizers) is fixed for each nutrient.  This is where the problems begin. The fixed selling price of urea today stands at Rs 268 per 50 kg bag. Until last year, the international prices (at $250 per ton) translated to close to Rs 1,000 per bag.  With the Russia-Ukraine crisis, urea’s price has since moved closer to $850 per ton (translating closer to Rs 3,500 per bag). The selling price in India hasn’t changed, and the balance is funded by the national exchequer.  This, in turn, creates two more problems. One, since the difference between production cost and sale price is reimbursed (two years ago, the subsidy amount ranged from Rs 11,298 per ton to Rs 25,772 per ton for different plants), there is little incentive for technological innovation or improving efficiency. Also, it stunts growth; over the past two decades, urea production has grown at a meagre 1.2% CAGR.  Second, it leads to rampant black-marketing. Prices in neighbouring countries (Nepal and Bangladesh in particular) are high, encouraging the illegal cross-border sale.   Subsidized urea was also used for industrial usage earlier, but neem-coated urea was introduced to check that. Monitoring over 600 million bags for whether that is actually done is another matter altogether.  The non-availability of cheap domestic gas for fertilizer plants creates further problems.  In 2015, the city gas distribution (CNG and  PNG ) or CGD was a “no-cut” sector, and supplies to fertilizer plants suffered (halved now from over 30 mmscmd in 2014). While the profits of CGD companies ( Indraprastha Gas ,  Mahanagar Gas  and  Adani Total Gas ) have tripled over the past decade, the fertilizer sector ecosystem (government and manufacturers) is in the doldrums.  There are a few investment implications from this. Today, the gas regulatory body ( Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board ) wants investments in the sector. The national gas grid is being expanded to 35,000 km (from 20,000 km) and the hope is that 300 million LPG users can be converted, via expansion of the CNG stations (4000 as of March 2022) and PNG connections (9 million today).  While one finds it difficult to invest in the fertilizer sector (what is the value of a business that is globally non-competitive and solely survives based on government subsidies), the runway for CGD companies appears reasonably long.  Nevertheless, traditionally, investors have been loath to ascribe a high multiple to businesses whose profitability widely depends on government policies. Questions like what if the gas allocation policy changes again or what if CGD companies are also brought under the regulated tariff arena might continue to haunt investors who are otherwise positive on this sector.   Separately, specific questions regarding this sector notwithstanding, learning to avoid the approach of putting a “band-aid on a bullet wound” can help us draw broader conclusions regarding our investment approach.

That said, the brokerage feels that the ongoing quantitative tightening (QT) cycle will keep a check on excessive valuations in the  stock market .  The domestic brokerage, which has a Nifty50 March 2023 target of 19,000, said it prefers themes based on investment rate, discretionary consumption and improving credit growth.  In a strategy note, the brokerage said the impact of operating and financial leverages are yet to kick in, given that the trailing return on equity (RoE) of the Nifty50 index has only reached 15 per cent against the peak RoE of 25-30 per cent in FY07-FY08.  Aggregate profit of listed  India Inc  stood at Rs 11.2 lakh crore, or 4.5 per cent of GDP on a trailing 12-month basis (TTM) and the bulk of profit expansion came from the mean-reversion of depressed profits and loss pools.  The loss pool, which stood at 0.6 per cent of GDP, is down from a two-decade high of 1.8 per cent in FY20. It has further scope to reduce as the peak  earnings  cycle ‘loss/GDP’ ratio was at 0.2 per cent in 2007, ICICI Securities said.   Overall profit/GDP has further scope to expand given capacity utilisation being suboptimal at 69 per cent (RBI’s OBICUS survey) and; industry credit growth (10.5 per cent YoY in July) still at a nascent stage of recovery. High-frequency indicators so far point towards easing input cost pressures while demand indicators remain robust thereby improving the profit outlook, ICICI Securities said.  Manufacturing and services activity remains robust with signs of declining input costs: PMI-manufacturing and PMI-services at 56.2 and 57.2 respectively along with GST collections at Rs 1.4 lakh crore for August 2022, are robust. However, exports stood at $33 billion (flat YoY) while imports surged to $61.68 billion reflecting robust domestic demand. Credit growth improved further although core sector growth moderated: Fortnightly non-food credit growth in August exceeded the 15 per cent YoY mark. Core sector growth in July, however, moderated to 4.5 per cent,\" the brokerage said.  ICICI Securities said monsoon progress across the country continues to be above average so far (except parts of east India), which is positive for rural India demand. The investment cycle, it said, remains conducive with large-scale capex announcements by capital-intensive corporates and a pickup in real estate cycle across India after a decade of underinvestment.   ICICI Securities said the quantitative tightening (QT) cycle continues and is well acknowledged by investors, thereby acting as a limiter to equity valuation expansion. However, the driver of the QT cycle is the inflation trajectory, which has shown initial signs of a peak formation along with a dip in commodity prices.  Unprecedented selling by FPIs on extreme QT cycle expectations begins to reverse driven by buying into domestic economy stocks. We maintain our March 2023 target for the Nifty50 at 19,000 given the positive outlook for profit, credit and investment cycles. However, we do not anticipate the earnings yield to breach the floor of around 5 per cent on the downside in a QT environment,\" it said.

That said, here’s a look at what some key indicators are suggesting for Tuesday’s action:  Global cues  Wall Street opened higher Monday while US Treasury yields hit three-year highs as investors eyed corporate earnings and what Russia's invasion of Ukraine could mean for global growth.  A significant cut to global growth expectations from the World Bank, paired with March weakness in China's latest economic numbers injected some pessimism into US markets, which opened Monday following a holiday-shortened previous week.  Corporate earnings are also expected to grab investors' attention this week, with several major firms reporting quarterly numbers. Bank of America kicked off the week by reporting stronger first-quarter profits than expected.  Stocks were up in early trading, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average rising 0.22%, the S&P 500 climbing 0.25% and the Nasdaq Composite up 0.23%.

Tech View: Death cross  Nifty50 on Monday made a 'Death Cross' as the 50-day simple moving average fell below its 200-day moving average. It is a strong bearish signal.   F&O: Support at 17,000  On the derivatives front, the highest call options OI is at 17,500/17,400 strike price followed by 17,200 while on the put side, acting as resistances, the highest put OI is at 17,000 strike price followed by 17200 levels, which will act as supports.

That said, here’s a look at what some key indicators are suggesting for Wednesday’s action:   US stocks rise  Benchmarks on Wall Street gained on Tuesday even in the face of surging Treasury yields as a positive earnings reports helped investors shrug off potential risks from an aggressive rise in US interest rates and the Ukraine war.  Shares of megacap companies like Microsoft Corp, Apple Inc and Amazon.com, typically sensitive to bond yields, jumped more than 1% despite hawkish comments from St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard.  The benchmark 10-year note yield rose to 2.924, while the 30-year U.S. Treasury yield hit 3% for the first time since early 2019.   European shares fall  European stock markets mostly fell Tuesday, as the impact of the Ukraine war spreads with the IMF slashing its global growth forecasts.  Trading for the first time since Thursday after an extended Easter weekend, London's benchmark FTSE 100 index was flat Tuesday afternoon, the Paris CAC 40 shed 0.7 percent and Frankfurt's DAX index was down 0.1 percent.  The International Monetary Fund sharply downgraded its 2022 global growth forecast to 3.6 percent in its latest outlook report Tuesday, 0.8 points lower than its previous estimate in January.   Tech View: decisively negative  A fag end selling sent Nifty50 below its support level of 17,000 on Tuesday. The index formed a Bearish Belt Hold-like candle on the daily chart, as the weakness was seen from the word go.   F&O: Support at 17,000  On the derivatives front, as we move closer to the expiry day, 17,200 has become a key hurdle now, from being a support a day before. On the other hand, 16,800 is emerging as the immediate support level.

Key drags on the investment rate since the financial year 2011-12 were the performance of the household sector and private corporates.  However, looking ahead,  ICICI Securities  identifies two sectors that hold great potential; to the extent of embodying what is a revered description in economic parlance – ‘animal spirits’.  These sectors are two that hold much importance as growth engines of the capital expenditure cycle – private industrials and real estate.  THE  CAPEX  ENGINES  “In our view, the private industrial capex cycle in India has formed a bottom over the past few years as evidenced by the trend of aggregate capex , and we are in the first stage of the revival driven by animal spirits in terms of capex announcements by industrial corporates,” analysts from the brokerage wrote.  In the period from FY12 to FY21, the contribution of real estate within the household sector to the gross fixed capital formation plunged to 25.4 per cent from 37.4 per cent, while that of industrial sector corporates dropped to 14 per cent from 21 per cent.  That trend may now be set for a reversal, the brokerage said.  The real estate outlook is showing improvement in terms of a clear bottoming out of house prices after a decade of declining growth and of late strong absorption has been witnessed while mortgage rates are still at record lows, the brokerage said.  The impact is yet to be seen in stock prices, with the BSE Realty index having shed 5 per cent so far in 2022.  The term ‘animal spirits’ which was coined by the legendary British economist John Maynard Keynes to describe motivations behind decisions, including financial ones, also applies to the recent announcements of corporate mergers and acquisitions, ICICI Securities said.  A key point emphasised by the brokerage was that while inflation and interest rates are now on an upward trajectory, empirical evidence since 1990 shows that these two factors do not have a negative correlation with real estate prices.  Another factor brightening the view on this round of capital expenditure is that corporate fundamentals are supportive of the ‘animal spirits’, hence suggesting a lower chance of capital being misallocated in the initial stages of the capex cycle, ICICI Securities said.  “Improved cashflows and profits for core sector companies after a decade of downward pressure: Our proprietary metric of aggregate ‘CFO/capex’ of listed India Inc. is currently at a 2-decade high of 2.1x (Rs 12trn CFO vs Rs 6trn of capex),” the analysts said.  “PAT to GDP ratio is on an uptrend reaching a decadal high of 4.3%. Improvement in aggregate corporate profits and cashflows is largely driven by cyclicals, which are the heavy lifters in private capex.”  Furthermore, capacity utilisation rose to 72.4 per cent in the third quarter of the previous financial year at a time when bank credit growth is also emerging from decadal lows.  SECTOR WATCH  Better demand for capital-intensive activities and higher commodity price realisations for producers bodes well for an investment revival in sectors such as power, metals, energy, construction and manufacturing.  “Services sector like telecommunication, digital e-commerce and IT will continue to see increased investment demand going ahead,” the brokerage said.  ICICI Securities’ top picks from a potential industrial investment and real estate cycle include State Bank of India, Axis Bank, HDFC, Ultra Tech, Larsen & Toubro,  Hindalco , Tata Steel,  Coal India , NTPC,  Bharti Airtel ,  Tata Communications , Ashok Leyland,  APL Apollo ,  Jindal Stainless ,  Phoenix Mills  and Greenpanel.  In the Budget for the current financial year, the government has set itself an ambitious Rs 7 lakh crore target for capital expenditure, up 35 per cent from a year ago and it seems likely that the Centre’s share in investment is set to rise even further.  “Government’s share of GFCF rose sharply from 10% to 16% during the decade from FY12 to FY21 and we expect it to rise further over FY22-23 going by budget estimates,”” the brokerage said.

Banking and auto stocks gained while metals and oil & gas stocks fell sharply in the week that saw the BSE Sensex rising 558.27 points or 1.02 per cent to 54,884.66, and Nifty50 by 86.30 points or 0.53 per cent to 16,352.45. Selling was, however, seen in the smallcap index, which ended 2.76 per cent lower, even as the BSE Midcap index settled flat for the week.  Pain in the broader market was visible clearly in the advance-decline ratio of the BSE500 index where 341 of the 501 index stocks settled lower for the week. At least 24 stocks saw double digit cuts while only eight index stocks ended the week with double-digit gains.  Among BSE500 names, the worst fall was seen in shares of steel makers, thanks to a hike in export duty on iron ore to 50 per cent across all grades from 30 per cent for lumps. The government imposed a 15 per cent export duty on hot-rolled, and cold-rolled steel products from nil earlier and announced export cuty on pellets at 45 per cent from nil earlier, making exports unviable.   The development sent shares of  Jindal Stainless  (down 23 per cent),  Jindal Stainless Hisar  (down 18 per cent), JSPL (down 17 per cent),  JSW Steel  (down 13 per cent) and  Tata Steel  (down 11 per cent) tumbling.

Analysts said the numbers were driven mainly by Covid-treatment drug molnupiravir supplies but felt the contribution from Covid-related products will start slowing from June quarter.  Divi’s continues to tackle pricing pressure in generic APIs and we expect these conditions to prolong for another 6-12 months. Logistical challenges are expected to weigh on operating margins given the higher freight rates and continued blockades at major global ports,\" Choice Broking said in a note.  An untimely resignation of MD & CEO P N Vasudevan, the previous week, sent shares of  Equitas Small Finance Bank  tumbling this week. Vasudevan's tenure ends on July 23 and the bank board will submit a revised proposal to the RBI to extend his tenure by one year (against its earlier proposal of a 3-year extension) to ensure a smooth transition process.  The stock fell 16.93 per cent for the week to Rs 43.65.  Shares of  Vaibhav Global  declined 16.83 per cent to Rs 334.60 on less-than-expected quarterly numbers.

Shares of  Welspun Corp saw  profit booking this week after rallying 46 per cent from May 12 to May 18. This stock fell 15.91 per cent for the week to Rs 206. Meanwhile, Welspun Corp's consolidated net profit fell 30 per cent to Rs 263.56 crore in March quarter on account of higher expenses, the company said on Friday.  Widening of losses hurt  Suzlon Energy  shares. The utility player reported a consolidated net loss of Rs 205.52 crore in the March quarter, which stood at Rs 54.25 crore in the quarter ended March 2021, according to a regulatory filing. This stock fell 15.88 per cent for the week to Rs 7.68.  Piramal Enterprises' March quarter results, especially losses reported by its financial service business, hurt sentiment. While  Piramal Enterprises  reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 150.53 crore, its financial service business reported a net loss of Rs 321 crore in the fourth quarter, due to poor asset quality, additional provisioning and interest reversals. This stock fell 14.2 per cent for the week to Rs 1,644.90.  NMDC ,  MRPL ,  Vardhman Textiles ,  Chambal Fertilisers and Chemicals ,  Gujarat Alkalies And Chemicals ,  Network 18 Media  & Investments,  ONGC  and Affle (India) were some of the stocks which fell 11-18 per cent for the week.  The volatility observed this week is expected to continue considering major economic data releases, the current earnings season, and the monthly expiry.

Data showed 166 stocks from the index fell over 10 per cent; among them, 31 stocks tanked over 20 per cent. The list comprised stocks from a host of sectors, including steel, paints, diagnostics, cement, textiles, midcap IT and financials.   The worst fall was seen in the steel sector.

Jindal Steel & Power, JSW Steel, SAIL and Tata Steel fell 30 per cent, 24 per cent, 21 per cent and 16 per cent, respectively, for the month.  Steel stocks  fell as the government took measures to bring down raw material costs. The month saw hiking of export duty on iron ore to 50 per cent across all grades from 30 per cent for lumps. The government imposed excise duty on pellets at 45 per cent from nil earlier, making exports unviable.  Further, an export duty of 15 per cent on hot-rolled, and cold-rolled steel products was introduced from nil earlier. The development, seen as extremely negative, resulted in multiple de-rating for the sector stocks.  Diagnostic stocks Dr Lal Pathlabs,  Thyrocare Technologies  and  Metropolis Healthcare  took a 19-32 per cent hit after unlisted firm Tata 1mg launched deep discounts on diagnostics tests to draw customers to its platform.  Concerns over heightened competition and a surge in oil prices, and thus oil derivatives, hit paints stocks with  Kansai Nerolac Paints  (down 14.6 per cent),  Berger Paints India , (down 14.49 per cent) and Asian Paints (down 11.7 per cent) falling up to 15 per cent.  Aditya Birla Group firm  Grasim Industries  has doubled the capital expenditure for its foray into the paints business to Rs 10,000 crore and expects to start production from the fourth quarter of FY24. In August last year, it had approved a Rs 5,000 crore capital expenditure plan to set up paints business.  Similar concerns weighed on cement stocks. The India Cements, Shree Cement,  The Ramco Cements  and Dalmia Bharat dropped 10-17 per cent on worries over rising input costs and Adani-Holcim deal.  Select real estate developers such as  Indiabulls Real Estate , Oberoi Realty and Sobha also saw their stocks falling 15-16 per cent. Among these stocks, Elara has upgraded Oberoi Realty to 'buy' from 'accumulate' following the recent slide. CLSA, on the other hand, has upgraded Sobha to 'Outperform' on favourable risk-reward post sharp fall in stock.  Chambal Fertilisers and Chemicals , GNFC,  Gujarat Alkalies And Chemicals  and  Anupam Rasayan India  were some of the chemical stocks that plunged 17-20 per cent for the month.

Midcap and smallcap IT stocks such as  Infibeam Avenues , Vakrangee and  eClerx Services  dropped 15-23 per cent.

The beginning was downbeat but the mood changed in the final sessions, thanks to a sharp recovery in the US indices.  Consequently, the benchmark indices, both  Nifty  and  Sensex , erased their losses and ended higher to close at 16,352.45 and 54,884.6 levels respectively. The sectoral indices traded mixed wherein banks and auto led the charge and rose over 3 per cent each. On the flip side, metal, pharma and realty ended with losses. The broader markets, despite a decent show in the second half, closed in the red wherein midcap ended lower by 0.8 per cent and smallcap by 3.4 per cent.  “The recent rebound in the US markets has eased some pressure. However, sustainability is critical for forming a base and attempting a reversal.

Jindal Stainless plunged 23 per cent and Jindal Stainless (Hisar) about 19 per cent during the week.    Divi’s Labs : Shares of the pharma company were also sold mercilessly during the week after the firm came out with earnings. This was despite the company said its consolidated net profit for the quarter rose 78.20 per cent compared. The stock settled     NMDC :  The miner was another casualty of the government’s effort to curb inflation in the country. The stock tumbled 15 per cent after the government imposed tariffs on export of minerals including iron ore.    Piramal Enterprises :  Shares of the diversifies company dropped over 14 per cent amid a profit booking despite the company logging a net profit of Rs 151 crore in the March quarter versus a net loss of Rs 510 crore in the corresponding quarter. The non-banking entity said it grew its assets faster than the industry average.    Mangalore Refinery ,  ONGC :  Oil companies were also among those that saw selling during the week. ONGC tanked 11 per cent ahead of its earnings, in which it recorded a 31 per cent jump in consolidated net profits. However, standalone net profit grew just 7 per cent despite a surge in global crude oil prices. For an inexplicable reason, shares of Mangalore Refinery were also down 14 per cent during the period.    AstraZeneca Pharma :  The stock jumped 16 per cent during the week, bucking the trend in the pharma sector, even though the company said its Q4 profits remained flat year on year. Though revenue recorded a modest rise.    AIA Engineering :  Shares of the company climbed 16 per cent as well as the firm said its profits saw sharp increase during the March quarter led by higher revenues.    Indigo:  Investors shrugged off widening losses for the low cost carrier and binged on the stock. The share price appreciated by 9 per cent. The company during the week said its losses for Q4 stood at Rs 1,681.80 crore.     "},

Steel rallying?  Many  steel stocks  ended the day with gains amid the reopening of China's economy, which is one of the top consumers of the commodity.  Tata Steel  was the biggest  Nifty  gainer, up 1.66 per cent.  Jindal Steel  and  Jindal Stainless  fared even better, rising about 2 per cent each.  Metal prices had crashed following the widespread Chinese lockdowns. To make matters worse, the government imposed export duties on certain categories like steel and iron ore.

But finding such names is not easy. A cursory screening of stocks that have declared results in the March quarter throws up 19 names that have more than doubled their profits in the last two years.  They are Tata Steel, Info Edge (India),  National Aluminium Company ,  Jindal Stainless ,  Greenpanel Industries ,  Godawari Power and Ispat , CSB Bank,  Sarda Energy  & Minerals,  Thirumalai Chemicals ,  Ramkrishna Forgings ,  Steel Strips Wheels , Hindware Home Innovation,  Best Agrolife ,  Everest Kanto Cylinder ,  Gokul Agro Resources , Xpro  India ,  Sportking India ,  Mishtann Foods  and  Nitin Spinners .  Some of them are obvious names, especially those that have benefitted from the commodity boom in the last couple of years. A few of them are little known names that have surprised investors and analysts.  Their performance is remarkable as it has come at a time when rising inflation has put pressure on margins and ultimately bottomline of companies. This is apparent from the depression in share prices as these stocks are trading at 20-50 per cent lower compared to their 52-week high prices.  “Persistent higher inflation and rates may also adversely impact demand, margins, and hence corporate earnings. This is already reflecting in earnings downgrades outweighing upgrades in India with nearly 3 in 4 stocks seeing earnings being revised downwards,” said SBI Mutual Fund in a recent note.  Now the question is, should you buy the above mentioned stocks? Analysts believe here you should become picky. Even though they are available at a deep  discount , and they have performed remarkably well, the outlook for each of them could be different.  For instance, shares of steel companies fell sharply recently after the government increased tariffs on exports. This is expected to hit their sales and profits. Though, some analysts say market reaction was too extreme and a value is emerging in them.  Metal prices had crashed following the widespread Chinese lockdowns. To make matters worse, the government of India imposed export duties on certain categories like steel and iron ore. This depressed domestic prices and led to a near 30 percent crash in stock prices of metal majors.

So prices are looking up. But so long as export duties remain, metal stocks are unlikely to rally beyond a point. But it is a fact that stock prices had over-reacted on the downside. This may be partly corrected.   Agencies  Among the above-mentioned names, consensus rating on Tata Steel, Jindal Stainless and Nalco hovers between buy and strong buy. Average target prices signal 30-120 per cent upside in them in the next 12 months.  Info Edge is another name that analysts are bullish on given India is emerging out of the pandemic strongly, and the booming internet market is set to benefit the companies and brands it operates. The company has delivered 556 per cent and 237 per cent profit growth in FY22 and FY21, respectively. Average broker target projects 28 per cent potential upside from current levels.  Greenpanel Industries is also a strong buy with potential upside of 34 per cent. CSB Bank has only one brokerage coverage with target at Rs 270 against current prices of Rs 186. Ramkrishna Forging is also a buy with consensus potential upside of 57 per cent.  Rest of the stocks have hardly any analyst coverage.

The RP and Jindal Stainless Steel did not respond to the request for comments.  The resolution professional opened the firm bids last week. Lenders are likely to negotiate with the highest bidder to improve the offer,\" said a third person aware of the development.  Indore-based Mittal Corp, which has two steel making units, has verified claims of Rs 1,587 crore. The offer from the highest bidder translates to a recovery of 16% for lenders.  Punjab National Bank ,  State Bank of India ,  IDBI Bank  and ACRE are among the key lenders of the bankrupt steel companies.  Mittal Corp is also among 15 shortlisted companies that would be transferred to the bad bank: National Asset Reconstruction Company Ltd.

In an attempt to rein in inflation, the government imposed a 15 per cent export duty on a range of finished steel products. This attempt is to discourage steel makers to export and cool off the prices in the domestic market.  Following the announcement,  Nifty Metal  declined nearly 9 per cent during the week, led by losses in the likes of  JSW Steel ,  Tata Steel ,  Jindal Stainless ,  Welspun Corp , etc. Many of the metals and mining stocks hit their 52-week lows in the process.  So, does this mean you can bottom fish in the sector and position yourself for any rally in these stocks? Analysts believe that will not be a wise choice, and if you want to buy, waiting will be a much better option.  “Investors should wait for some more dip in the metal sector and once the situation settles down, they should start accumulating fundamentally good scripts for long term gains,” said Mohit Nigam, Head - PMS, Hem Securities.  India has been increasing its steel exports over the last two years and has the potential to become part of a larger global supply chain. Thus, shares of metal companies also rallied on improving outlook drawing more buyers. But this hike of export duty on steel will be negative for the steel sector in the near future and we can see pressure on metal going forward, said analysts.  Technically, Gaurav Bissa, Vice President at Trustline Securities, underlined that metals had been one of the strongest performing sectors and also one of the last to witness a correction led by negative divergence on the RSI and MACD.  “The index has seen a bounce on account of being oversold on smaller time frames. On the daily chart, the index has support at the 4,950 level and a close below this can lead to incremental pressure on the index. Traders and investors should wait for a follow up buying to emerge above 5,300 levels before deciding to buy into the metal names,” he said.  Pritesh Mehta, Lead Technical Analyst - Institutional Equities, YES Securities, remarked that the inter-market relationship is in a mess currently, which is taking a toll on the commodities space.  “US dollar index retreated off its peak, yet the structure is bullish, a pullback is seen in commodity currency, i.e., Australian Dollar Futures, yet the overall structure is bearish. If these situations persist, there appears to be no point in calling a bottom in metals space,” he said.  “Ratio of Nifty Metal vs Nifty is trading below the yearly mean, implying a continuation of metals underperformance against the benchmark index. Cool-off in DXY has led to some respite in metals space, yet it continues to be a vulnerable place, prone to high swings. Rather than chasing a beaten down space, sticking to recent outperformers like autos and banks would provide a better trading opportunity.”  ( Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views, and opinions given by the experts are their own.

After a massive outperformance last year, the metal counters are melting sharply, so much so that the BSE Metal index formed a Death Cross on Tuesday.  The index hit a 52-week low of 16,901.9, following a steep 29 per cent correction in two months from its 52-week high of 23,742.99.  The Death Cross is a chart pattern that indicates the transition into the bear grip. This technical indicator occurs when the short-term moving average (say, 50-day) of a stock/sector crosses from above to below a long-term moving average (say, 200-day).  The formation of Death Cross is signalling more pain ahead for investors.  The majority of the stocks from metal, iron, steel or related sectors are in a tight bear grip. Data from Ace Equity suggests that more than 100 stocks from metal and related sectors are down more than 20 per cent from their latest peaks. More than 20 names have plunged between 50-65 per cent.  Among wealth destroyers,  Manaksia Coated  Metals, Nova Iron,  Ankit Metal  & Power,  JSW Ispat Special  Product and India Steel Works lead with over 60 per cent fall from peaks.  Renowned names, including National Steel, Jindal Stainless,  Jindal Stainless  (Hisar),  Steel Authority Of India  (SAIL) and  Sandur Manganese  & Iron Ores and  Tata Metaliks  have eroded more than half of investors' wealth.   ETMarkets.com    ETMarkets.com  Among other big names,  Tata Steel Long Products  (48 per cent down),  Godawari Power And Ispat  (47 per cent down), Jindal Saw (44 per cent down), KOICL (42 per cent down),  Gujarat Mineral Development Corporation  (41 per cent down) and NMDC (40 per cent down) are key wealth eroders.   ETMarkets.com     ETMarkets.com  Bluechip firms  Hindalco Industries ,  Jindal Steel  & Power, Tata Steel, Vedanta,  Hindustan Zinc  and JSW Steel have also plunged 30-45 per cent from their 52-week highs.   ETMarkets.com  Market analysts do not see any recovery in these counters in near term, thanks to restrictions and curbs induced by the Covid-19 scare in China -- the largest consumer of metal in the world. Meanwhile, India’s iron ore prices are likely to stay decoupled from seaborne ore prices due to the export duty of 15 per cent imposed by the government on iron ore and pellets, said experts.  China’s steel spreads remain muted, which should support steel prices and limit the downside from current levels. However, China’s steel demand is the key to revival, noted Equirius Wealth. The rally in coking coal prices – triggered by the Russia-Ukraine war and weather-related disruptions in Australia – has now ended, probably faster than expected. India’s non-integrated steel companies have emerged as the lowest-cost producers in the world.  The decline in coking coal demand in the past few weeks could be attributed to the return of coking coal supply from Russia and weak global demand.  Nomura  believes that coking coal demand in India weakened in May and is likely to remain weak in 1HFY23. This, it said, is putting pressure on profitability given the onset of monsoons.  Demand for coking coal from Australia is likely to remain weak even as steel output from China gathers pace as Chinese mills are procuring coking coal from Russia at lower prices, against Australian coking coal,\" it added. Key economic indicators in China remain significantly weak, said Nomura. \"In the first week of June, steel inventory with traders rose due to weak demand owing to festival holidays and weather conditions.  Equirius Wealth said it remains positive on non-integrated steel players, with Jindal Steel & Power as its top pick. NMDC is our top sell call in the ferrous space as the company is likely to be the most impacted by falling ore prices in India, it added.  Nomura, meanwhile, has a 'Reduce' rating on JSW Steel with a target price of Rs 500, whereas Sharekhan has suggested holding SAIL with a target price of Rs 80. Sharekhan also has a buy rating for  Grasim Industries  with a target price of Rs 1,740. We retain our preference for non-ferrous counters with Hindalco (Target Price: Rs 555), Vedanta (Target Price: 414) and GMDC (Target Price: Rs 230) as our key picks,\" said Edelweiss Securities.

This equates to a recovery of 16% for these lenders.  The lenders have put the debt on the block. NARCL will have the right to match any counteroffers.  State-owned banks account for nearly 89% of Mittal Corp's outstanding debt while the rest 11%, or ₹173 crore, is held by Asset Care & Reconstruction Enterprise (ACRE), an ARC backed by Ares SSG Capital. NARCL's offer will equate to ₹256 crore if it includes ACRE's claims. Its anchor offer is a combination of 15% as  cash payment  and the balance as  security receipts  (SR) guaranteed by the government.  NARCL did not respond to ET's request for comment until press time Monday.  Lenders have invited expressions of interest by October 6, and the Swiss auction is on October 20, according to the bid document issued by their process adviser  PNB Investment Service .  The banks expect at least two counterbids at the Swiss auction, people cited above said.   Lenders have stipulated that any counterbid should have a mark-up of at least 6% over the anchor offer, equating to ₹242 crore. The challenger bid can be in cash or a combination of cash and SR. However, the SRs will have to be guaranteed by a 'first class bank', as per the offer document, but it has not defined 'first class bank'.  NARCL's offer, equating to ₹256 for the entire debt, is much lower than ₹282 crore offer made by Rimjhim  Ispat  for Mittal Corp, which is currently undergoing insolvency proceedings.  National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) ordered lenders to terminate voting on resolution plans midway and invite fresh offers following a petition filed by Shyam  SEL  & Power, another bidder in the fray, promising an improved offer. Rimjhim Ispat and  Jindal Stainless  Steel, another bidder for Mittal Corp under the insolvency process, have moved the appellate tribunal against NCLT's order.

Stocks that have witnessed bullish crossovers include Atishay,  NCC ,  Sun Pharma ,  Tata Steel ,  Marksans Pharma ,  Aries Agro , Reliance Defence, HCL Infosystem, Piramal Enterprises,  Jindal Saw , L&T Technology Services,  Usher Agro ,  Supreme Industries  and  Borosil Glass .

In stock-specific developments, Sun Pharma on Tuesday informed the bourses that one of its wholly-owned subsidiaries has received final approval from USFDA for its abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) for the generic version of Zetia.   On the other hand, 83 stocks witnessed bearish crossovers on BSE on Monday, which signalled a longer bear grip on the market. Stocks on the list included RBL Bank,  Punjab National Bank ,  Karnataka Bank ,  Voltas ,  Crompton Greaves , UPL,  Anuh Pharma  and  McDowell Holdings . (See table: MACD crossed below signal line)      MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows a relationship between two moving averages of prices. The MACD is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages. A nine-day exponential moving average, called the ‘signal’ line, is plotted on top of the MACD to show ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ opportunities. A ‘buy’ signal occurs when the MACD rises above its signal line and vice-versa.   However, the MACD alone may not be sufficient to take an investment or trading call.   Traders should make use of other indicators such as Fibonacci series,  Relative Strength Index  (RSI), candlestick patterns,  Bollinger Bands  and stochastic to confirm any trend.   It is advisable to consult a financial expert before taking any buy/sell decision on a stock based on this parameter alone.   On Monday, the Nity50 index settled 51.85 points, or 0.54 per cent, down at 9,616.   On further movement of the domestic equity market, Mustafa Nadeem, CEO, Epic Research, said: “In the short term, the Nifty50 will have resistance at 9,700 while support is seen at 9,580, which will decide the market trend in the near term.”   Understanding MACD       A close look at the chart of Tata Steel would show whenever the MACD line crossed above the signal line, the stock has always shown an upward momentum.   The latest bullish crossover was recorded on Monday despite the Nifty50 having closed in the red. "},

Noticee, Nirmal Kotecha,...shall be restrained from accessing the  securities market  and further prohibited from buying, selling or otherwise dealing in securities, directly or indirectly, or shall not associate with the securities market in any manner, whatsoever, for a period of two years,\" Sebi said in a 17-page order.  Earlier, the regulator, through orders in March 2018 and October 2018, had imposed ban of 14 years and 1 year respectively on Kotecha with respect to fraudulent trades in Pyramid Saimira Theatre shares.  In the view of the same, Sebi noted that the restriction imposed on him on Tuesday shall run concurrently with the period of debarment imposed earlier.  Sebi's directions follow an investigation conducted by it between August 2008 and December 2008 after it noted that the scrip of Usher Agro rose from Rs 107.30 on August 19, 2008 to a high of Rs 208.75 on September 11, 2008 and then continuously declined to Rs 84.05 on December 31, 2008.  The regulator noted that Kotecha was part of a group comprising 12 entities which indulged in self trade by purchasing scrips accounting for 15.20 per cent of the market volume and then sold 15.13 per cent of the market volume.  The execution of self trade resulted in no change of beneficial ownership and created artificial volume in the scrip of Usher Agro, which gave a false and misleading appearance of trading in the shares.  Thus, he violated Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trading Practices norms.  In addition, Kotecha held shares in various beneficiary accounts maintained with various depository participants and held less than 5 per cent of equity in each account, during the quarter ended March 31, 2009.  However, by aggregating the shareholding of all his accounts, his shareholding exceeded 5 per cent of total share capital of Usher Agro and he was required to make requisite disclosures under Prohibition of Insider Trading and Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeover norms, but he failed to do so, the regulator said in its order.

I firmly suggest adding more shares of GIC Re at current price to reduce your average cost – over 20% fall in its stock price from its listing price, relatively cheaper valuation, expansion plans of international business and robust growth of outlook of domestic insurance industry give me a lot of confidence in this reinsurance stock.

Should I hold or sell?—MANJUSHA  At this juncture it is quite risky to hold Visa Steel as there is a lot of uncertainty regarding the resolution for its debt issue. There is a possibility of both lenders and stakeholders sacrificing their material interests in the process of its debt resolution. If you are a long term investor, you may hold Bharat ETF as this kind of ETF can give significant returns only in the long term.

Even the flop show from the majority of the software exporters have dented the sentiments further.  With a free fall in the Indian currency, the domestic unit is kissing the 80-mark against the  dollar  and IT firms are expected to benefitted from this fall as majority of their revenue is earned in dollar terms.  However, in the first week of July 2022, a number of IT companies announced their earnings and missed the street estimates. This led to a steep fall in the Nifty IT index which is hovering around its 52-week lows.  The Nifty IT index has wiped off about one third of its value in the last six months, whereas the index has tanked close to 22 per cent in the last three months only.  Sentiments for IT stocks are negative because of the sharp correction in the Nasdaq and looming fears of inflation in the United States,\" Kranthi Bathini, Director - Equity Strategy, WealthMills Securities, told ETMarkets.  Amid recession fears, IT spends and budgets of companies took a huge blow, which is denting future earning sentiments for tech companies.  On the other hand, the US dollar is not strengthening only against the Indian Rupee. The greenback has firmed up across all the major currencies and other currencies from the emerging market.  The cost for IT companies has increased due to higher attrition rate, inflated compensation and increased travelling cost which have hurt the operational performance and margins of the IT sector, neutralising the windfall gains of weak rupee,\" Bathini added.  Smaller IT companies including  Brightcom Group ,  Xelpmoc Design ,  3i Infotech , Subex,  Zensar Technologies ,  Tanla Platforms , Take Solutions have plunged between 50-70 per cent in the year 2022 so far.  Even popular names including Larsen & Toubro Infotech,  Tech Mahindra , Wipro, L&T Technology Services,  Birlasoft ,  Coforge ,  Mindtree ,  Sasken Technologies ,  Ramco Systems ,  Newgen Software Technologies  have plunged up to 45 per cent.  Market experts, however, believe that IT remains a strong defensive bet in tough times. IT stocks have created solid wealth in the last few years and one should not write them off on the basis of one or two bad quarters, they advise.  Bathini from WealthMills suggested that investors with a decent risk appetite should look at midcap IT counters, whereas conservative investors should use the dips to accumulate bluechips like  Tata Consultancy Services  and  Infosys .  Tata Consultancy announced its earnings on July 8 for the June 2022 quarter, whereas Infosys is yet to disclose its earnings for the period.  However, independent market expert Sandip Sabharwal said that one should not buy IT stocks right now as he sees another 10-15 per cent fall in the stock. He is waiting for management to turn bearish to take a contra call on the sector.   (Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

RBI is likely to maintain status quo at its monetary policy review on Wednesday as it would like to gauge the impact of  GST  rollout on  inflation , say experts.   Meanwhile, directors of companies that have not been carrying out business for a long time are set to be disqualified from holding directorship in any registered firm for up to five years, as part of the government's intensified efforts against the black money menace. Shell companies are dubious entities that are generally used for laundering illegal wealth. With nearly three lakh companies under the scanner, the government is preparing to initiate stringent steps against erring entities, including striking off their names and taking action against directors , said sources.   Here's a look at eight macro-economic triggers that are likely to impact the market and more.   PSU banks to raise Rs  58K cr this year   In a move that will ease the pressure on the exchequer of pumping in capital, public sector banks, including SBI,  Bank of Baroda  and IDBI Bank, plan to raise Rs 58,000 crore through equity dilution during the current fiscal. The move will help the banks to meet Basel-III norms and clean up their balance sheets. Leading the pack, country's largest lender SBI plans to raise Rs 15,000 crore through share sale by the year-end, probably through a qualified institutional placement (QIP). The Bank of Baroda and  Central Bank of India  plan to raise Rs 6,000 crore and Rs 65,000 crore from capital  markets , respectively.  Oriental Bank of Commerce  and  IDBI Bank  have taken board's approval for raising Rs 5,000 crore each through equity dilution, while Mumbai-based  Union Bank of India  plans to Rs 4,950 crore during the current fiscal. This will be over and above Rs 70,000 crore banks will get as capital support from the government. PSU banks have accumulated bad loans of a staggering Rs 6 lakh crore.   Which sector will create most  jobs ?   If the latest Assocham report is to be believed, the era of jobless growths is coming to an end and sectors like  real estate , retail, wellness and transport and logistics may create the most jobs in the near future. The Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (Assocham)-Thought Arbitrage Research Institute joint report also said India's information technology and IT-enabled services (ITeS) sector may add at best one million jobs in the next five years. According to the report, building, construction and real estate, including infrastructure, sector would require 31.1 million incremental jobs. Besides, organised retail can create incremental level of at least 10-12 million new jobs in the next five years, while textiles and clothing can also be a potential area of job creation, the report added. The central government think-tank the  Niti Aayog  on Friday trashed unemployment surveys as unreliable and said it has set up a task force to produce authoritative annual nationwide employment data based on household surveys.   The first-ever bad loan action   In the the first auction of bad loans by the two commercial banks after the  Reserve Bank of India  revised norms for sale of bad loans,  Andhra Bank  and  Allahabad Bank  have put up for sale nearly Rs 6,000 crore of bad loans amid mounting pressure on state-run lenders to clean their books. While Andhra Bank wants to sell off more than 100 accounts adding to about Rs 4,000 crore of loans, Allahabad Bank has invited bids for 73 accounts with outstanding loans of Rs 2,000 crore. The assets on sale include Seven Hills Hospital, Visa Power,  Visa Steel , L&T Chennai Tada Toll Road, KS Oil, Transstroy India and a few of its associate companies, Maheshwari Ispat and Abhijeet Power. Nearly two dozen asset reconstruction companies or ARCs will participate in bidding for the bad loans on offer.    RBI likely to hold rates   The Monetary Policy Committee of the Reserve Bank of India is expected to keep the cost of funds unchanged at its scheduled meeting this week, but could lower their forecast on inflation and retain the option of cutting rates toward the latter half of the year if consumer prices remain muted. An ET poll of 21 FIs showed that most respondents expect the central bank to hold headline rates. Yet a change in sentiment is quite palpable. For FY18, the RBI has projected inflation to average 4.5% between April and September, and 5% in the latter half, with the risks balanced along the inflation trajectory. But India’s retail price gauge has dropped to a record low of 2.99% in April, from a near five-month high of 3.89% in March, because of the base effect and lower food prices. But, as long as liquidity is not posing a threat to inflation, RBI will not be in a hurry to raise the policy rate.    India slides in competitiveness index, China moves up   India has been ranked 45th, down four notches from last year, in terms of competitiveness in the annual rankings compiled by IMD which saw Hong Kong topping the list. As India slid, China improved its position by seven places to 18th, thanks to its dedication to international trade. US was \"pushed out\" of the top three slots while Hong Kong consolidated its dominance of the annual rankings for the second year in the list compiled by the International Institute for Management Development's (IMD) World Competitiveness Center. Switzerland and Singapore were ranked second and third respectively, with the USA at the fourth spot -- its lowest position in five years and down from third last year. The Netherlands completed the top five, jumping up from eighth last year. For the first time this year, the IMD World Competitiveness Center also published a separate report ranking countries' digital competitiveness. At the top of the digital ranking is Singapore, followed by Sweden, the USA, Finland and Denmark, while the bottom five are Indonesia, Ukraine, Mongolia, Peru and Venezuela.

Most of the companies on the list are said to be from the infrastructure and power sectors. ETNow quoted sources as saying that the second list is likely to be released in September.   Shares of Visa Steel fell 1.24 per cent in Tuesday’s trade to Rs 19.90 after the news. This stock is down 26 per cent in last three months, and 60 per cent in last five years.   Videocon shares fell 3 per cent to Rs 18.35 on Tuesday after having wiped out 60 per cent of its market capitalisation in last three months. In last five years, the stock has lost 90 per cent of its value. Shares of Uttam Galva slipped 0.56 per cent to Rs 26.70 on Tuesday, adding to the 13 per cent decline on the counter in last three months.   Steel stock JSPL declined 2.5 per cent to Rs 132.45 on Tuesday, after having risen 10 per cent in last three months.   The central bank is likely to advise the lenders to haul these companies to the National Company Law Tribunal for bankruptcy proceedings.   When contacted for reaction, JSPL told ETNow: “As a policy, we don’t respond to speculative queries.”   In each case, the debt level varies between Rs 3,000 crore and Rs 50,000 crore. Queries ETNow sent to Uttam Galva and Videocon did not extract any response immediately.   “One should not think that just the first set of companies that have been identified alone are the problem. There is problem certainly down the line also,” R Gandhi, Former Deputy Governor, RBI, told ETNow.   These companies were definitely put on alert when RBI announced the first list of accounts, which should be taken to IBC. At that time the banks and these accounts should have resolved their cases. Since voluntarily resolution has not been forthcoming, it has to be taken for compulsorily through the legal process, Gandhi said.   The second set of references, if it is coming, will send out a clear message to all that you should take this process seriously and if you want to resolve it quickly with voluntary efforts, that is welcome, failing which the authorities will take the necessary action under the law, he added.   In June, an internal advisory committee of the central bank had identified the first batch of 12 accounts of corporate borrowers for insolvency proceedings under the newly-enacted Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 (IBC).   Each of these companies owed over Rs 5,000 crore with a total involvement of around Rs 1,75,000 crore, accounting for up to 25 per cent of the current gross non-performing assets in the banking system.   Indian banks are burdened with an estimated Rs 8,00,000 crore bad loans, which has virtually crippled the system and drastically slowed down credit flow in the economy. "},

Banks have been forced to set aside significant amounts to cover the risk of default, which have dented their bottom lines, and they are under pressure to hasten the debt resolution process, the Mint report suggested.   Latest quarter  earnings  showed gross non-performing assets (NPAs) across listed banks stood at Rs 6.42 lakh crore at the end of June 2017. New measures for debt resolution may provide some relief to the sector.   Debt-ridden companies such as  Videocon Industries , Castex Technologies, Essar Projects,  Visa Steel ,  Jaiprakash Associates ,  SEL Manufacturing , Soma Enterprises, Orchid Pharma and  Uttam Galva  Steel figure in RBI’s second list of defaulters.

The company has an outstanding debt of over Rs 40,000 crore.   Jaiprakash Associates had total debt of Rs 39,000 crore as of March 31, 2017, while Uttam Galva had Rs 6,192 crore.   The  NCLT  has so far decided more than 650 cases under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code.   The NCLT has also admitted a petition of  Bank of Baroda  against Amrapali Silicon City owned by  real estate  major Amrapali group. The tribunal created history in August by ordering winding up of two companies - VNR Infrastructures and Bhupen Electronic - under the new Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code after the borrowers and lenders failed to come up with plans to revive the businesses.   On Monday, the  Supreme Court  had stayed similar insolvency proceedings against real estate firm  Jaypee Infratech  on a plea by some home buyers. But on Tuesday, the apex court agreed to hear a plea by  IDBI Bank  seeking modification of the order.   A bench comprising Chief Justice  Dipak Misra  and Justices Amitava Roy and A M Khanwilkar considered the submission of the bank that staying the order of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) in Allahabad had reversed the position and, as a consequence, the company had gone back to defaulting promoters.   The apex court has posted the IDBI Bank’s plea for hearing on September 11. "},

As economic slowdown is weighing down on debt-ridden balance sheets of several companies including large infrastructure companies resulting in asset sales and takeover by lenders, there could be several other sale which could either be exit from core business or stake sale by promoters.   Large infrastructure companies have already been cutting debt, selling non-core assets and in some cases have even knocked-off quality assets to ease the debt burden on the books.   Debt-heavy companies like HCC, JP Associates,  ABG Shipyard ,  GMR Infrastructure ,  Bhushan Steel ,  IVRCL ,  Punj Lloyd  and  GVK Power and Infrastructure  have been underperforming the markets.

Another brokerage firm  ICICI Securities  has maintained its underweight stance on the sector and prefers stocks that have the potential to continue gaining market share even in a slowdown.  Its top picks are TCS, Infosys, MindTree, Persistent Systems and Coforge.   (Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

Though Indian IT companies have reported strong revenue growth in the June quarter, with most also maintaining or increasing their guidance, analysts remain cautious about the sector because of the concerns over a slowdown in the US, the biggest market.  The Nifty IT index has declined 23% so far this year, compared with a 1% rise in the main Nifty50 index, due to worries about slowing revenue growth, margin woes and elevated valuations of the companies.  We believe the macro slowdown poses a risk that is likely to see a cut in legacy spending, as historically we have seen strong correction between customers' revenue growth and technology spending,\" said Vikas Ahuja, analyst, Antique Stockbroking. \"Large companies such as  TCS ,  Infosys  and  HCL Tech  are safer bets to play the current volatility, while we suggest adding quality midcaps such as  Coforge ,  Mindtree , and LT Infotech on correction.  There has been a significant underperformance of the IT stocks in recent months even though the earnings growth of the sector is currently in line with long-term averages, and the guidance by the IT companies is generally buoyant. Stock prices of  HCL Technologies ,  Wipro ,  Tech Mahindra , L&T Infotech, Mindtree and  Mphasis , among others, have fallen between 25% and 40% so far in 2022. The one-year forward PE multiple of most of the companies are close to their historical averages.  Tech spending declined or were flat for major US banking companies like the Citi Group, JP Morgan and Wells Fargo, but up in the mid-single digit for Bank of America and double-digits for Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, according to a report by Kotak Securities. Interestingly, the spending trajectory is stronger among the banks that sounded more cautious on expenses and future investments, the report said.  “Strong IT spending by the US banking and financial majors are positive for Indian IT companies. More fundamentally, we find a strong correlation between fixed investment in intellectual property in the US and the performance of Indian IT companies,” said Sujan Hajra, executive director, Anand Rathi Shares. “Fixed investment in intellectual property in the US is rising, which bodes well for Indian IT companies.”  While earnings per share would be supported by rupee’s depreciation, on margins and supply side cover, analysts expect hiring and attrition to ease off ahead.  If the US goes through a milder recession, then companies such as Mphasis, Birlasoft, L&T Infotech and MindTree should be able to maintain high growth rates given their order backlog, and hence there is a case for these companies to be in the core portfolio, said Mohit Jain of Anand Rathi Shares.

The outstanding loans for these five accounts are a little over ₹41,000 crore. The list also includes three road projects - Sion Panvel Tollways Ltd, Supreme Panvel Indapur Tollway and Chhapra Hajipur Expressway Ltd - which are likely to attract investors, the people said. The remaining accounts are Consolidated Construction Consortium Ltd, Rainbow Papers, Helios PhotoVoltaic Ltd, Mittal Corp, World Windows Impex India, Ruchi Worldwide and SSA International, the people said.  NARCL will provide a binding offer to lenders following which the lead bank will hold a Swiss challenge auction inviting counter offers from other asset reconstruction companies. NARCL, being the anchor bidder, will have the right to match the counter offer, if any.   The government had announced the launch of the bad bank in last year's budget, but the launch was delayed after the Reserve Bank of India declined to approve a dual structure in which NARCL was supposed to acquire distressed assets while India Debt Resolution Company Ltd (IDRCL) was responsible for the resolutions, as first reported by ET on January 3.  Following RBI's advice lenders have changed the arrangement so that there is a principal-agent relationship between the two, wherein NARCL will be the principal agency acquiring bad loans while outsourcing its resolution to IDRCL, its agent. NARCL will be the final authority to decide on resolutions proposed by IDRCL.  VoVL, the oil exploration company promoted by Venugopal Dhoot, which was admitted by the National Company Law Tribunal for bankruptcy proceedings, has received expressions of interest from government-owned ONGC and Vedanta, among others. The resolution professional has extended the timeline for applicants to submit a firm resolution plan. As per the list circulated among lenders, an outstanding claim of ₹22,128 crore will be transferred by banks led by SBI to NARCL.  Among others, Jaypee Infratech is in an advanced stage of resolution. Lenders have approved a plan submitted by Suraksha Realty along with Lakshdeep Investments and Finance and the tribunal is scheduled to hear details of the plan on February 7. Lenders will transfer ₹7,950 crore of Jaypee Infratech loans to NARCL, the people said. The resolution of Jaypee Infratech has been going on for over four years as it is among the initial 12 companies that RBI had directed lenders to refer to NCLT in August 2017.  Last June, lenders had drawn a list of 22 companies to be transferred to NARCL. This was revised to 15 names last month to exclude companies such Lavasa Corporation and Amtek Auto since their resolution is nearly complete. Incidentally, SBI-led banks have excluded Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group promoted Reliance Naval and Engineering Ltd (RNEL) from the first list, which has surprised some market participants.  "},

The subject has assumed importance because banks have never invoked a government guarantee in the past. Senior bank officials conveyed their reservations on the subject to the NARCL management at a meeting last week, the people cited above said.  NARCL, an integral part of the key bad bank initiative announced by the government in the FY21 budget to help clean up bank books, has yet not acquired a single non-performing loan from lenders.  A government guarantee is the biggest attraction for lenders to sell stressed loans to the NARCL.

The balance 85% would be in the form of  security receipts  (SR) that would be redeemed at a pre-determined price by the end of five years.  Last September, the Cabinet approved a proposal to provide ₹30,600 crore in government guarantees on SRs issued by NARCL. This guarantee can be invoked if there is a shortfall in the redemption of the SRs.  Lenders are now seeking clarity on how this guarantee would work if there is a shortfall in recovering bad loans. \"Banks have never invoked even the guarantees issued by government-owned institutions. Here we are talking of invoking sovereign guarantee,\" said a banking veteran attending the meeting. \"We don't have a precedent to follow,\" he added.  The sale agreement between NARCL and lenders will have to spell out the terms of invoking the guarantee, potentially delaying the sale of bad loans.  NARCL has proposed to acquire about ₹2 lakh crore of bad loans and its agent, the India Debt Resolution Company (IDRCL), would be mandated to recover them.  During the last week's meeting, lenders also discussed issues related to management fees and the valuation of these accounts that could be sold.  NARCL informed lenders that they are in the process of making offers to acquire some of the loans from the initial list issued a year ago. It has also circulated a new list of 17 accounts, including those of the two Srei companies and a few Future Group companies. The second list, with outstanding loans of ₹93,240 crore, seeks to gauge lenders' interest in selling those loans.  Rainbow Papers, VOVL,  Visa Steel , and GTL are some of the accounts in the first list.  "},

Operating profit margins for IT companies shrunk further in June 2022 and are now below pre-Covid levels for tier-1 companies in the sector. The companies had reduced their margin guidance at the start of FY23.

Brokerage firms, however, do not expect them to report any surprise amid the economic gloom.  Majority of them remain skeptical over margins and profitability of the software exporters as the macro economic signs wane the hopes after mass layoff, despite positive management commentary and depreciating rupee.  The IT sector is expected to post resilient Q2 performance in context of the current macro environment. Mid-tier IT’s growth outperformance is expected to continue in Q2, the brokerage firms said.  Tier-1 IT companies are expected to deliver sequential growth in the range of 2.4-4 per cent constant currency. Cross currency impact severity will be similar to last quarter with -1.3 to -1.8 per cent sequential impact for Tier-1, said  HDFC  Securities.  Within the mid-tiers,  Tata Elxsi ,  Mindtree , and Persistent are expected to lead at above mid single digit sequential growth, it said. \"Supply-side normalisation can be construed as positive from the operational/margin perspective.  Despite the macro challenges in Europe, contracting activity remains strong, the brokerage said. \"Accenture’s outsourcing bookings are at an all-time high and the top end of revenue guide also indicates demand resilience.  HDFC Securities is expecting a 242 basis points (bps) drop in the EBIT margins on a yearly basis for the larger IT players, whereas second rug IT counters may see a 1 per cent compression, taking the average hit on the entire sector to 228 bps.  Management commentary by Indian IT Services players has been positive post 1QFY23, but the street will be looking beyond this, particularly the guidance for the future.  Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities, which is underweight on the IT sector, said that most macro indicators in the developed markets have been deteriorating and many more customer verticals beyond mortgages and retail are stressed.  While we expect robust QoQ CC revenue growth for players under our coverage and QoQ margin improvement, the street is looking beyond this into what might transpire in 2HFY23 and FY24, it said.  Robust revenue growth expectation is based on the strong order intake momentum seen in the previous quarters, the analysts said. Significant cross-currency headwinds would restrict US dollar revenue growth.  While margins may have bottomed out in 1QFY23, it remains to be seen how much of an improvement there will be on a QoQ basis as some companies would have implemented salary hikes fully or partially in 2QFY23,\" said Nirmal Bang.  3QFY23 commentary will be keenly evaluated as body language of almost all management indicates that it is not only going to be a seasonally weak quarter due to furloughs, but will also be impacted by the macro deterioration.  Dalal Street will be keenly looking at the total contract value for 2QFY23 and 2HFY23 deal inflow outlook with visibility is good and pipeline, along with inflation and energy challenges across the globe among others.  With a weakening macro environment and looming fears of recession, we will be watchful of any moderation in the demand commentary across both Tier I and Tier II companies in the IT Services space, said  Motilal Oswal .  While our recent discussions with various management indicate continued spends on technology services, we expect some impact across sectors for the remaining part of the year, it said.  The growth deficit in Tier I players versus Tier II peers will further narrow in 2QFY23,\" it added. \"We see a limited change in the FY23 revenue growth guidance of Infosys,  HCL Technologies ,  Coforge  and L&T Technology Services given the unchanged demand commentary.  In the largecap IT space, HDFC Securities has a buy call on Infosys, whereas other four IT majors have an 'add' rating. In the midcap IT segment, Mindtree,  Cyient  and  Sonata Software  are a buy, whereas Tata Elxsi is a sell from the brokerage.  Motilal Oswal prefers Tier I players over their Tier II counterparts, given their relative valuation attractiveness and diversified client portfolio. Among Tier II  IT stocks , we prefer  Mphasis  and L&T Technology Services.   (Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views, and opinions given by the experts are their own.

Tech Mahindra , in which the FIIs hold over 30% stake, has been the top loser in  Nifty IT index . While in the last one month, the stock has lost over 9%, wealth erosion on a year-to-date basis has been that of nearly 43%. Shares of  Wipro  are also down around 43% in 2022.Other top losers in the pack include  Coforge ,  Mphasis , L&T's tech twins and  MindTree . The selloff has been so deep that the best performing Nifty IT stock -  TCS  - is also down 18% YTD.  The stark underperformance comes amid consistent paring of stakes by FIIs in IT stocks which is their second largest bet in India after banking and financial services.  “There are concerns of decline in orders for the segment if the US tips into a recession soon. But these fears have not yet translated into reality,” said Dr VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at  Geojit Financial Services .  Even as the recent selloff in IT stocks comes just ahead of the Q2 earnings season, analysts said this cannot be construed as indicative of a weak quarter ahead for the IT sector.   Accenture’s Q4 results and its guidance for FY23 have reassured investors that IT spends are not slowing down.  Analysts say the IT sector is expected to post reasonably strong Q2 topline performance with minimal adverse impact from the current volatile environment. However, margins may remain a mixed bag due to continued supply-side pressure with elevated attrition and individual impact from wage hikes.  “We forecast sequential revenue growth of 2.5-5% in c/c for large companies and 3.5-5.5% for  mid-tier companies. Growth will be led by strong spending on digital competencies by clients and the translation of TCV into revenues,” Kotak Institutional Equities said.  Edelweiss  Securities expects most stocks under its coverage to deliver strong CC revenue growth in Q2 on the back of robust deal-wins in previous quarters, strong headcount addition and improvement in pricing mix.

Among tier-I players, we prefer TCS, HCL, and  Infosys ,”  Motilal Oswal  said while maintaining its positive stance on the sector due to a favorable medium to long term demand outlook despite near-term pain.

The weaker-than-expected  TCS  earnings added to existing concerns over a potential US recession that is feared to hurt deal pipeline for  IT companies  and impact growth in FY24. Some analysts said further sell-off could prompt investors to buy large-cap  IT stocks .  TCS shares dropped 4.6% to ₹3,113.25 on Monday, leading the tumble in IT stocks.  HCL Technologies ,  Nucleus Software ,  Persistent Systems ,  Zensar Technologies , and  Coforge  fell 3-4%.  Infosys  fell 2.7%,  Tech Mahindra  fell nearly 2% and  Wipro  fell 1.9%. The NSE IT Index dropped 3.1%, while the Nifty ended almost unchanged over Friday.  TCS margins were a disappointment and the outlook in terms of growth for the September quarter may not be great,\" said Hemang Jani, head of equity strategy, broking and distribution,  Motilal Oswal Financial Services . \"Management commentary is positive, but at the same time, it is talking about the possible impact of slowdown in the US.  Shares of software exporters are in bear territory with the BSE IT index declining 26% so far in 2022. From its all-time high, the index is down 27.6%.  Analysts are divided on outlook for the sector. Last week, brokerage Jefferies downgraded shares of select IT companies HCL Technologies, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Larsen & Toubro Infotech,  Mindtree  and Coforge as it believes revenue growth of the sector is likely to moderate due to a likely recession in the US in FY24.  Jefferies said it expects earnings cuts to drive further PE de-rating for IT stocks. It is most bullish on Infosys.   A brief rebound in these stocks could be in the offing, said Rohit Srivastava, founder, Indiacharts.com.  IT stocks have corrected so much that weaker numbers have been discounted to some extent,\" he said. \"The sector is oversold and there is room for a short-term bounce though I won't say this is the time for a long-term buy.  Some analysts do not expect a sharp fall in these stocks from current levels.  IT stocks are now starting to look attractive and this is not the time to sell IT stocks. With another 5-6% decline the sector stocks will become even more attractive,” said Siddarth Bhamre, research head at  Religare  Broking. He is bullish on HCL Technologies on the grounds that it is the most cheaply valued among large-cap IT stocks.  Jani of  Motilal Oswal  said midcap IT stocks are riskier bets compared to their large-cap peers.  “Midcap IT stocks carry a slightly higher risk of disappointment on growth, so we are more comfortable  buying  large-cap IT stocks than midcap IT stocks,” said Jani.  “The sector has corrected around 30% from recent highs, maybe another 5-7% is possible but we are not looking at a bigger fall and we will be looking at adding large-cap IT names on correction,” said Jani.
