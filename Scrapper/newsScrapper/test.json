    "article": "Indias biggest merger ever will likely take away from the rupee bond market one of its top issuers, an absence that may weigh on debt sales and arrangement fees for banks. The consolidation of Housing Development Finance Corp. and unit   Ltd. will create a more than $200 billion financial services behemoth, and the parent will be able to tap the banks deposits to grow, rather than pile on more debt. Thats not all bad for Indias bond world as the hole created by the shadow lender may let new borrowers sell notes, helping India deepen its debt market. The shadow lender is Indias biggest bond seller in 2022, with its issuance accounting for 7.7% of the countrys total issuance volume this year, higher than an average of about 6% in the last 10 years, Bloomberg-compiled data show. The merged entity will be a bank and is still likely to offer notes when needed to boost its capital buffers and fund infrastructure projects. HDFCs exit will initially hurt overall sales volume next year, said Jayen Shah, founder of Mavuca Capital Advisors Pvt., a fintech investment banking firm. I expect a lot of first-time issuers, state and private companies tapping the bond market next year as yields stabilize, which may then gradually fill the void. The merger, expected to conclude in the second quarter of 2023, will give HDFC access to16.7 trillion rupees($202 billion) of funds comprising so-called low-cost current and savings account deposits and time deposits of the bank. That will let it continue expanding its assets, which stood at6.9 trillion rupeesat the end of September. Theexitof a debt issuer of that size risks hurting the fee income of bankers who have arranged HDFCs various offerings. In the last few years, Axis Bank Ltd. and ICICI Bank Ltd. have overseen most of those sales, Bloomberg-compiled data show. For HDFCs competitors, though, the firms exit may be a positive in fundraising terms. The departure of HDFC from the bond market would benefit its peers as it will give them access to a larger pool of credit, Mavucas Shah said. That in turn will cut funding costs of other top-rated housing finance companies."

    "article": "Net interest income for the quarter at Rs. 210 billion grew by 18.9% over prior year and 7.9% over prior quarter. The core net interest margin for the quarter was at 4.1% prior year was also at 4.1% and prior quarter was at 4%. Based on interest earning assets, the core net interest margin was at 4.3%. Other income for the quarter, which included Fees and commission income constituting 3/4th of other income was at Rs.58 billion and grew by 17% over prior year and 8% over prior quarter. Retail constitutes approximately 93% of the fees. The fixed and derivatives income at Rs.9.5 billion was higher by 9.3% compared to prior year. During the quarter operating expenses, which were at Rs.112.3 billion, an increase of 21% over prior year and an increase of 6.9% over prior quarter. HDFC bank added 1,813 branches and 2,226 ATMs since last year, 121 branches and 248 ATMs last quarter taking the total network strength to 6,499 branches, 18,868 ATMs and 15,691 business correspondence. Cost to income ratio for the quarter was at 39.2%. On the advances side, which were at 14.79 trillion grew by 6.1% sequentially and 23.4% over prior year. The retail advances growth was robust.

Total deposits amounted to Rs. 16.73 trillion an increase of 4.3% over prior quarter and up 19% over prior year. In retail deposits, the bank added Rs. 710 billion during the quarter and Rs. 2,350 billion since September. Retail constitutes about 83% of total deposits, retail deposits have been the anchor of their deposit growth. HDFC Bank already had a huge opportunity with the under-penetration of banking services in the country. The proposed merger adds an entirely different dimension to the future. We believe that the runway is huge. HDFC Banks earnings trajectory remains on track with continued growth in retail. The ongoing expansion of branch network and cards business, coupled with the merger, is expected to aid long-term growth. Nevertheless, the banks long-term outlook remains positive. We thereby retain our BUY rating on the stock, with a revised target price of Rs. 1,908. "

    "article": " on January 20 said its revenue from operations for the quarter ended December 2022 (Q3FY23) came in at Rs 220,592 crore, up 15.32 percent against Rs 191,271 crore reported a year ago. Its consolidated net profit for the third quarter of FY23 stood at Rs 17,806 crore, down 13.30 percent year-on-year (YoY). Profit after tax, excluding the impact of an exceptional item that boosted the bottomline in 3QFY22, marginally improved by 0.6 percent year-on-year. RIL had booked sale from its divestment of shale gas assets that resulted in an exceptional item of Rs 2,836 crore in the third quarter a year ago. Net profit attributable to owners of the company, excluding non-controlling interest was Rs 15,792 crore, which was 15 percent lower than a year ago. Company officials said higher finance costs were due to interest rate hikes by central banks and higher loan balances. According to an analyst poll conducted by Moneycontrol, its net profit was expected to grow 4.4 percent to Rs 16,366 crore from a year earlier. Revenue was expected to rise 21 percent YoY to Rs 2.23 lakh crore. The company said its EBITDA increased by 13.5 percent YoY to Rs 38,460 crore ($4.6 billion), on account of strong growth in the subscriber base for its digital business, growth across consumption baskets, improvement in middle distillate cracks and higher gas price realisation with an increase in ceiling price, and marginally higher volumes in the Oil & Gas segment. \"All segments contributed to the robust growth in consolidated EBITDA on a YoY basis,\" said Mukesh D. Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director, Reliance Industries. \"Our teams across businesses have done an excellent job in delivering strong operating performance through a challenging environment. Jio Platforms, which is the telecom and digital services subsidiary of the company, reported 28.6 percent YoY growth in net profits at Rs 4,881 crore. Its revenue from operations was at 24,892 crore, up 20.9 percent YoY. EBITDA increased 25.1 percent YoY to 12,519 crore. Revenue growth was driven by a steady increase in both the subscriber base and average revenue per user (ARPU) for the connectivity business. EBITDA increase led by revenue growth and margin improvement, the company said, adding that EBITDA margin increased by 170 basis points due to increased ARPU and benefit from lower spectrum usage charges. Net subscriber addition was 5.3 million as gross adds remained strong at 34.2 million in 3Q FY23, RIL said. ARPU increased 17.5 percent YoY to Rs 178.20 per subscriber per month due to a better subscriber mix. Sequentially, it rose 0.56 percent. \"Jio delivered record revenues and EBITDA driven by strong momentum in customer growth and data consumption,\" said Ambani. \"This quarter we launched True 5G services. It is now available in 134 cities and towns in India, enhancing the customer experience while enabling next-generation services.\" RIL's retail business reported net profit growth of 6.2 percent YoY to Rs 2,400 crore. Revenue from operations rose 18.6 percent YoY to Rs 60,096 crore. EBITDA increased 24.9 percent YoY to Rs 4,773 crore. The company said the revenue increase was led by well-rounded growth across all baskets and channels. EBITDA from operations increased with a 70 basis point margin improvement driven by a favourable mix, operating leverage and efficiencies. During the quarter, Reliance Retail increased its store count to 17,225. The quarter also recorded the highest-ever footfalls at 201 million across formats and geographies. The company said Digital Commerce and New Commerce businesses continue to demonstrate the strength of their business model and grew 38 percent YoY and contributed to 18 percent of the revenue. Our performance during the quarter demonstrates the underlying strengths and efficiencies of our business model that enable us to serve our customers with excellence at all times,\" said Isha M Ambani, Executive Director, Reliance Retail Ventures. \"We remain steadfast in offering the best shopping experience across all our stores and digital platforms to deepen our bond with our customers and vendor partners. Segmental revenue for the oil to chemicals (O2C) business rose 10 percent YoY to Rs 1,44,630 crore. EBITDA increased 2.9 percent to Rs 13,926 crore. Commenting on the energy vertical, group Joint CFO V Srikanth said, Energy businesses accounted for 70% of incremental growth on a quarter-on-quarter basis. He said that the oil and gas segment maintained stable production and higher realisation led to higher contribution. Revenues increased on account of higher price realisation as crude oil prices went up by 11 percent year-on-year, said the company in a press release. Revenue growth was constrained by lower throughput with planned Maintenance & Inspection activity turnaround during the quarter. Srikanth added, Volatile price environment and weak demand from China impacted downstream margin. Growth in EBITDA was supported by strength in middle distillate cracks. This was, however, partially offset by weak margins across polymer, polyester chain and light distillates products. Continued SAED (special additional excise duty) on transportation fuels also impacted earnings by Rs 1,898 crore, RIL added. The company sees Middle Distillate cracks to remain firm on lower inventories, seasonal demand, and the impending loss of Russian oil products. Meanwhile, petrochemical feedstock price volatility will likely continue amidst uncertain geopolitical situations and recessionary trends in developed economies, it said. Srikanth attributed the quarter-on-quarter 12% decline in crude oil prices to demand and recession fears in Europe, the USA. However, the official added, Indias demand for fuels and downstream products remained strong even as global demand declined. RIL management said that the global oil demand is estimated to grow by 1.9 million barrels per day in 2023, led by the US, China and India. Srikanth said that some of the new capacity that will be commissioned in the second half of 2023r would result in an effective net global refining capacity addition of around 1 million barrels per day, so while their margin will get some support, the upside would be limited. Revenue for the oil and gas segment, which refers to RIL's exploration and production business, increased 74.8 percent YoY to Rs 4,474 crore led by improved gas price realisation and higher production. The companys outlook for the gas market remains positive. Gas price realization is expected to remain high in near-time even though some cool-off has happened, said Sanjay Roy, Senior Vice President exploration and production at RIL. The average gas price realised for KGD6 was at $11.3/MMBTU in 3QFY23 vs $6.1/MMBTU in 3Q FY22, with the raising of gas price ceiling to $12.46/MMBtu by the Government of India. EBITDA increased 90.9 percent YoY to Rs 3,880 crore. EBITDA margin was at 86.7 percent. RIL said geopolitical uncertainty and constrained supply are likely to keep gas prices firm in the near term while incremental production and higher prices will support EBITDA growth in the near term. Net profit for its media business was at Rs 9 crore, down 97.1 percent YoY. Revenue from operations, meanwhile, increased 11.6 percent to Rs 1,850 crore primarily driven by the movies and sports business amidst a challenging advertising environment. The continued softness in the macroeconomic environment dampened the advertising demand and ad revenue of all our segments was down on a YoY basis, RIL said. EBITDA declined sharply on YoY basis with the drop in advertising revenue directly impacting margins as investments in content continued with a view to consolidating operating metrics. The company said inflation has been showing signs of cooling off, but the revival of consumer demand remains crucial for growth in the media business. Our strong positions across verticals put us in a pole position to grow once the macroeconomic environment normalises, it added."

    "article": "HDFCB reported lower than expected credit growth  up 20% YoY/2% QoQ, in Q3 (vs 24% YoY/6% QoQ, in Q2). This was mainly due to de-growth in the corporate book (down 1% QoQ/up 20% YoY), while Retail continued its strong growth momentum (up 21.5% YoY/5% QoQ), as did Commercial Banking (at 30% YoY/5% QoQ). We believe, this should support margins amid rising funding costs. Credit growth, gross of IBPCs and bill rediscounted, also stood low, at 24% YoY/3% QoQ in Q3 vs 26% YoY/7% QoQ in Q2. The Mortgage-Book purchase from HDFC Ltd continued to be high, at Rs88.9bn in Q3 (vs Rs91.5bn in Q2). Deposit growth of the bank remains healthy at 20% YoY/4% QoQ, while other banks continue to struggle. Overall CASA growth was slower at 12% YoY/ flat QoQ (Retail CASA grew 14%YoY/1% QoQ), which led to a slight decline in CASA ratio, at 44% vs 45% in Q2. We believe slippages could remain elevated in Q3 due to seasonal stress in the Agri portfolio (including KCC) which, coupled with slower credit growth, could keep NPA ratios largely flat. With the bank sitting on healthy, specific + contingent provisions, we expect LLP to moderate, which should thereby support net profitability. We believe that slower credit growth coupled with lower fees and elevated opex in the run-up to the merger could keep core-profitability growth in check. Post the recent uptick, the stock is currently trading at 2.7x FY24E ABV (ex-subs valuation). We retain our long-term BUY rating on the stock, given healthy return ratios, strong capital comfort and reasonable valuations. We will revise our estimates/TP post the results, once we attain better clarity on the growth/margin outlook and the merger process from Management. "

    "article": "The share price of  , operator of retail chain D-Mart, closed 1.45 percent lower on January 13, a day ahead of its Q3 results announcement. The Street is expecting a consolidated net profit of Rs 646.5 crore, indicating a 17 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth but a 5.5 percent drop sequentially. Q3 started on a steady note with retail companies witnessing strong demand offtake during the festive season (Navratri-Diwali). However, demand momentum started waning off during November and December, according to ICICI Securities. Consolidated revenue from operations is expected to come in at Rs 11,504 crore, growing 25 percent YoY and 8.1 percent sequentially. EBITDA (Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) is seen at Rs 1,010 crore, up 16.6 percent YoY and 13.4 percent QoQ. In its  , the company said it added four stores in the October-December quarter taking the total count to 306. \"Estimates stood at 12,\" said analysts at Motilal Oswal Financial Services. In Q1, the company had added 10 stores, followed by eight in Q2. The hypermarket chain operator reported standalone revenue from operations at Rs 11,304.58 crore for the quarter ended December FY23, increasing 25 percent from Rs 9,065 crore in the same period last year. Both store additions and revenue growth were lower than Street estimates. A key factor to watch in the results announcement will be gross and operating margin numbers. ICICI Securities expects EBITDA margins to contract by 60 basis points YoY to 8.8 percent. This will largely be on the back of seasonal weakness, said analysts. During the  , the management highlighted that the FMCG and staples segment of the business had performed better than the general merchandise and apparel segments. The inflationary stress is more acute at lower price points in the discretionary non-FMCG category, the company had said. Analysts and investors will be keenly monitoring if theres any improvement in the revenue share of general merchandise and apparel segments, which are the higher margin businesses."

While grocery centric DMart Ready ramp up and competition could be other reasons, but we remain confident of the business moat of DMart, both in offline and DMart ready model. While we cut estimates, our 4Q23 estimates now factor in 28% sales growth, 8% EBIDTA margins and 31% PAT growth. Given just 22 store openings in 9M23, we expect addition of 18 stores in 4Q. We estimate 27.8% YoY PAT CAGR over FY23-25 (ex of Rs1407.7mn tax write-back in FY23). We believe DMart has a huge runway to grow with 1500+ store potential (current stores 306) in a consolidated market and scale up in DMart Ready. Any meaningful correction can be used as a good entry point. Retain Buy. We cut EPS estimates of DMart by 4.2/4.3/4.0% for FY23/24/25 and target price to Rs4675 (Rs4854 earlier) following disappointing margin performance in 3Q23 (106 bps YoY EBIDTA margin decline to 8.3%). Mix deterioration due to tepid growth in Apparel and general merchandise impacted margins. Cost of retail also moved up by 50bps YoY as operating leverage failed to benefit in a festival quarter. "

This could affect growth for the IT sector with higher impact on Tier-2 IT players because of vendor consolidation. Nifty IT Index has run-up by 9% since Oct22 (post Q2FY23 earrings season) and we thus advise investors to be selective with a focus on companies with growth visibility and reasonable valuations. We maintain a Buy on HCL Technologies with an unchanged PT of Rs. 1,140, given strong growth in application services, good dividend payout, healthy order intake and reasonable valuations (trades at 16x/14.4x FY24E/FY25E EPS).

Concerns on growth in granular retail liabilities vs. peers are expected to fade away as the bank has started gaining market share on CASA front (10% system growth vs. 14% for Axis in the past one year) aided by leveraging digital ecosystem, focusing on corporate salary account acquisition, and cross-sell liability products to existing clients. Further, Citi Banks acquisition is expected to improve CASA ratio by 200bps. Branch expansion is likely to further accelerate growth. NIM gap vs. core peer (ICICI Bank) is also narrowing (at 36bps in H1FY2023 vs. 64 bps in H1FY2022). Return on RWA is now closer to its peers; improved underwriting practices by taking learnings from past cycles are key positives. It has already converged on loan growth, credit cost, and ROE with the frontline banks. Due to all these factors, we see the bank emerging as stronger in this leg of upcycle and valuation multiple inching higher closer to its peers. At the CMP, the bank trades at 2.0x/1.7x/1.4x its FY2023E/FY2024E/FY2025E Core BV, offering attractive risk reward. We maintain Buy with a revised PT of Rs. 1,140.

    "article": "AXSB has progressed well over past few years and has strengthened its balance sheet by making it granular, increasing the mix of retail loans and improving its PCR. As a result, its key metrics such as loan growth, margins and profitability have improved. Loan growth is witnessing a healthy recovery with 14-18% growth over the past four quarters (vs 13% CAGR over FY19-22), driven by retail loans (18% CAGR). Small business banking (SBB)/rural loans posted a robust CAGR of 49%/23%. The rural and semi-urban market remains a key focus area, which should enable sustainable loan growth over the medium term. We, thus, expect a 17% CAGR in loans over FY22-25. AXSB has multiple levers in place to offset the rise in the funding cost as 68% of loans are floating, which, coupled with the rising mix of high-yielding loans and a gradual reduction in low-yielding RIDF bonds (3% of assets), should help margins. AXSB remains focused on building a stronger, consistent, and sustainable franchise. Since asset quality issues are behind, slippages and credit cost will be under control. While the bank will continue to make investments, it expects to bring down the costto-assets ratio to ~2% by FY25-end. The bank achieved its target of a consolidated RoE of 18% in 2QFY23 and remains on track to deliver a sustainable RoE of 18% in the medium term.

The company is scheduled to announce its Q3 results during market hours on January 19. The numbers are set to be hit due to muted volume growth, analysts said. One reason is the high base effect. We expect overall volume growth of 4 percent YoY on a base of 18 percent YoY in Q3 FY22, analysts at Nuvama Research noted. Volume growth will also be impacted due to extended rainfall in October, which affected festive demand. Moreover, pent-up after the COVID-19 lockdowns has eased and inflation has affected discretionary spending. All this will impact volumes, analysts said. However, November and December marked a good recovery, particularly in exterior paints, which is a higher-margin product, Nuvama Research said. EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) margin for the quarter has been pegged at 17.1 percent, higher by 250 basis points sequentially. According to Kotak Institutional Equities, margin expansion will come on the back of a further fall in crude oil prices, but will be partly offset by deterioration in the product mix. We expect EBITDA margin to contract YoY due to lower operating leverage, it added. Asian Paints said on January 8 it will set up a water-based paint manufacturing facility with an  .

Moreover, stable Opex (C/I at 50.3% v/s 49.4% in 2QFY23) led to superior ROA of 2.5%. We believe the bank to further soar its profitability driven by higher growth, healthy margins, robust non-interest income and lower provisioning. We recommend BUY factoring a best in class ROA of more than 2%. We expect KMBs loan book to grow at CAGR of ~22% over FY22-24E. At CMP of 1763, the stock is available at 3.7(x) standalone FY24E Adj. BVPS of 479. Valuing the standalone entity with 4.1xFY24E BVPS and subsidiaries valuation at 84; we arrive at a target price of 2,046. We recommend BUY with a potential upside of 16%. "

    "article": "Kotak Mahindra Bank (KMB) posted a 12% beat on PAT at Rs27.9bn, mainly owing to better margins and continuation of the contingent-provision drawdown, albeit partly offset by higher opex/staff expenses. Bank has indicated that it would continue investing in franchisee/technology/people and, thus, cost ratios would remain elevated. Credit-growth momentum was strong at 23% YoY/6% QoQ, but deposit growth is lagging, including CASA growth (ratio down 700bps YTD to 53%). Though NIM improved 30bps QoQ to a high of 5.5% on asset re-pricing in 3Q, it should decelerate hereon, as deposit growth as well as funding cost catches up, leading to some pressure on PPoP growth. Asset quality further improved, with 18bps contraction in GNPA ratio to 1.9%. Bank does not see any incremental asset-quality risk and continues to consume the contingentprovision buffer, unlike large peers who have retained/are re-building buffers. We raise our FY23 earnings estimates by 2%, but lower for FY24E/FY25E earnings by 3%/6% due to margin deceleration from the peak and higher opex. We expect RoA to normalize to 2% in FY25E from a high of 2.2% in FY23E, and RoE to settle at around 13%. Also, we believe that the impending MD change in Jan-24 will emerge as a key overhang on the stock in the near-to-medium term, as we move closer to the event. Thus, we trim our P/ABV for the standalone bank to 3x from 3.5x earlier, and revise our TP downwards to Rs2,000 (including subs value at Rs550 post 20% discount). We also lower our rating on the stock to HOLD from BUY. "

EBIT margins remained resilient at 21.5%, as cost optimisation and INR depreciation were fully offset by higher SG&A, furlough and third-party costs. Deal wins were strong with TCV for Q3FY22 being strongest in the past eight quarters at $3.3 billion. The management revised upward its revenue growth guidance to 16-16.5% in CC terms for FY2023 versus 15-16% earlier. The management expressed weakness in mortgage, investment banking, Telco, Hi-tech and Retail verticals and said clients here are looking at cost optimisation rather than digital transformation programs. Despite strong growth in Europe and North America at 13.6% and 10% q-o-q, respectively, the management has indicated that the outlook for Europe is concerning, while it is relatively better for the US. Given looming global headwinds, the outlook for FY24E looks uncertain and with gradual recovery in the coming quarters. However, we believe the structural growth story for the Indian IT sector remains intact. We maintain a Buy rating on Infosys with an unchanged PT of Rs. 1,730 given strong deal pipeline, its end -to-end capabilities and prowess in digital areas, analytics, automation and Cobalt cloud.

MD&CEO reiterated banks stance of assessing employees based on overall bank performance as individual targets hinder offering a holistic experience. Our perception of commentary was that ICICIB would continue to profitably grow by focusing on superior customer experience. Sustained client focus, digital capabilities coupled with a micro-market based approach has resulted in strong retail/SMB growth of 25%/36% YoY in Sep22 while on the liability side, retail average SA balances have grown by 50% over Mar19 to Sep22. Tech spends should remain elevated which contribute 9% to opex (6% in FY20) however as interest cost starts pressurizing NIM, opex intensity would reduce. While our estimates are unchanged for FY24/25E, we remain optimistic on ICICIB with visible RoA/RoE for FY25E at 1.9%/16.2%. Currently, stock is valued at 2.55x on Sep24 core ABV and we maintain multiple at 3.0x and TP at Rs1090. Retain BUY. "

Digital is emerging as a force multiplier and, thus, the bank has seen more than 1.5-2x growth across select business segments at a far lower customer-acquisition/servicing cost. The bank has also partnered with multiple newage fintechs/start-ups in co-lending, liability, analytics, and collection space to acquire digitally native customers, increase wallet share, manage credit risk and, thus, improve customer-level RoE. The ICICI-Amazon card has been one such partnership offering increased customer acquisition (>3.5 mn cards) coupled with higher-than-industry spend (1.2x) and activation rate (70%). We retain BUY with a revised TP of Rs1,225 (Rs1,170 earlier), rolling forward the standalone bank at 2.8x Dec-24E and subsidiaries at Rs225.

    "article": "Billionaire Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Industriesdelivered strong operating performance for the quarter ended December FY23, with contribution from all segments. \"Our teams across businesses have done an excellent job in delivering strong operating performance through a challenging environment. All segments contributed to the robust growth in consolidated EBITDA on YoY basis,\" Mukesh Dhirubhai Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director said. Its consolidated net profit for the quarter stood at Rs 17,806 crore, down 13.30 percent year-on-year (YoY). Profit after tax, excluding the impact of an exceptional item that boosted the bottomline in Q3 FY22,  . RIL had booked sale from its divestment of shale gas assets that resulted in an exceptional item of Rs 2,836 crore in the third quarter a year ago. Net profit attributable to owners of the company, excluding non-controlling interest was Rs 15,792 crore, which was 15 percent lower than a year ago. The consolidated gross revenue for the quarter at Rs 2.4 lakh crore increased by 14.8 percent compared to corresponding period last financial year, supported by continuing growth momentum in consumer businesses. Digital services and retail segments recorded double-digit growth. \"Higher realization in O2C (oil-to-chemical) business with increase in energy prices along with nearly 2x growth in oil & gas business also contributed to growth in revenue,\"  said in its filing to exchanges. The oil-telecom-to-retail conglomerate has recorded a 13.5 percent YoY increase in EBITDA at Rs 38,460 crore for the quarter. EBITDA is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. The company said the operating income was backed by strong growth in subscriber base and 17.5 percent increase in ARPU (average revenue per user) in digital services segment. Growth across consumption baskets, addition of new stores and rising contribution from digital channels in the retail segment also supported EBITDA for the quarter. Improvement in middle distillate cracks (partially offset by weak downstream chemical margins and SAED (special additional excise duty) related costs in O2C segment), and higher gas price realization with increase in ceiling price, too, aided the growth in operating income. Depreciation increased by 32.6 percent YoY to Rs 10,187 crore due to expanded asset base across all the businesses and higher network utilization in digital services business. Finance costs at Rs 5,201 crore for the quarter jumped by 36.4 percent compared to year-ago period due to increase in interest rates and loan balances. Jio Platforms recorded double-digit growth across earnings parameters with revenue and EBITDA at the highest ever levels on quarterly basis. Consolidated profit for the quarter grew by 28.6 percent to Rs 4,881 crore compared to corresponding period last fiscal, with nearly 17 percent on-year fall in finance cost at Rs 1,047 crore in Q3FY23. Consolidated revenue at Rs 24,892 crore surged 20.9 percent compared to year-ago period, driven by steady increase in both subscriber base and ARPU for the connectivity business. In addition, the company said higher realizations from digital services drove JPL's consolidated revenue growth. Jio reported ARPU at Rs 178.2 per subscriber per month, up from Rs 177.2 in previous quarter and gaining significantly from Rs 151.6 in same quarter of last financial year. Its customer base was at 432.9 million as of December FY23, up from 427.6 million at the end of September FY23. It had a customer base of 421 million as of December FY22. At the operating level, EBITDA increased by 25.1 percent YoY to Rs 12,519 crore led by revenue growth and margin improvement. The margin expanded by 170 bps due to increased ARPU and benefit from lower spectrum usage charges. Jio has extended coverage of its True5G services to 134 cities across 22 states and union territories of India. It remains on track to complete its pan India 5G rollout by December 2023. \"Within three months of launch, Jio True5G is now available across 134 cities and would be available across India by December 2023,\" Akash M Ambani, Chairman, Reliance Jio Infocomm said. In addition, he said Jio would connect over 100 million premises with JioFiber and JioAirFiber, \"offering unparalleled digital experiences\". Also, Reliance Retail business recorded highest ever quarterly revenue and EBITDA for the quarter with highest ever footfall at 201 million across formats and geographies for Q3FY23, against 160 million footfall in Q3FY22 and 180 million in Q2FY23. The retail business registered a 6.2 percent on-year growth in profit at Rs 2,400 crore with double-digit growth in topline and operating income. Revenue increased by 18.6 percent YoY to Rs 60,096 crore for the quarter led by well-rounded growth across all baskets and channels. EBITDA from operations at Rs 4,657 crore jumped by 32.2 percent YoY with a +70-basis point margin improvement driven by favourable mix, operating leverage and efficiencies, Reliance said. In O2C business, \"middle distillate product fundamentals remain strong with firm demand, constrained supply, and high natural gas prices in Europe. Downstream chemical products witnessed margin pressure with excess supply and relatively weak regional demand,\" said Mukesh Ambani. The business recorded revenue at Rs 1.44 lakh crore for the quarter ended December FY23, growing 10 percent over the corresponding period last fiscal led by higher price realisation as crude oil prices went up by 11 percent. The topline growth was constrained by lower throughput with planned maintenanceand inspection activity turnaround during the quarter, the company said. EBITDA for the O2C segment at Rs 13,926 crore grew by 2.9 percent on-year supported by strength in middle distillate cracks. \"EBITDA was, however, partially offset by weak margins across polymer, polyester chain and light distillates products. Continued SAED on transportation fuels also impacted earnings by Rs 1,898 crore,\" the company said. The higher price realisations despite lower downstream product volumes boosted exports for the quarter by 21 percent YoY to Rs 78,331 crore. The upstream business delivered robust growth with sustained production from KG D6 block along with higher realization, said Mukesh Ambani. Reliance is on track to reach 30 MMSCMD of gas production in FY24 after the commissioning of MJ field. This will significantly enhance Indias energy security in a volatile energy market environment, he said. The oil & gas exploration & production business registered a 74.8 percent YoY growth in revenue at Rs 4,474 crore for December FY23 quarter, led by improved gas price realization and higher production. Average gas price realized for KGD6 was at $11.3 per MMBTU (million British thermal units) in Q3FY23 against $6.1 per MMBTU in Q3FY22, with raising of gas price ceiling to ~ $12.46 per MMBtu by the Government of India, Reliance said. EBITDA for the quarter at Rs 3,880 crore increased sharply by 90.9 percent over corresponding period last fiscal. KGD6 production during the quarter at 41.9 Bcfe (billions of cubic feet equivalent) was up by 6.1 percent YoY, the company said. The media business has recorded consolidated gross revenue of Rs 2,166 crore for the quarter, growing 12.5 percent YoY, primarily driven by movies and sports business amidst a challenging advertising environment. The company said the continued softness in the macro-economic environment dampened the advertising demand and advertising revenue of all segments was down on a YoY basis. Core categories continued to spend on advertising, but driving growth was challenging due to restrained spends by brands across categories and a sharp pull-back by start-ups and e-com players, it added. On the operating front, EBITDA at Rs 52 crore declined sharply by 86.7 percent on YoY basis with the drop-in advertising revenue directly impacting margins as investments in content continued with a view to consolidate operating metrics. The profitability of the business also suffered due to investments in new initiatives, digital entertainment and sports, which had a negative contribution of around Rs 140 crore to EBITDA, Reliance said. Reliance's capital expenditure for the quarter ended December 2022 was Rs 37,599 crore, increasing significantly from Rs 27,582 crore in the corresponding period of last fiscal. Outstanding debt was Rs 3.03 lakh crore and cash and cash equivalents were Rs 1.93 lakh crore as of December FY23. \"Strong balance sheet and robust cash flows remains the cornerstone of our commitment in growing existing businesses as well as investing in new opportunities,\" Ambani said."

A gradual revival in the rural economy, good traction to winter care portfolio and price cuts post raw material price correction will help posting better volume growth in H2FY2023 compared to H1. Significant decline in prices of key inputs (including palm oil) will help the OPM to improve from Q3FY2023.

Starting January 27, stocks from   Ltd. to  Ltd. and   Ltd.  together comprising 80% of the countrys equity market  will be settled on a trade-plus-one-day timeline versus the earlier two-day process. The yearlong changeover gave market intermediaries time to prepare, said Prashant Vagal, executive vice president at National Securities Depository Ltd. This last step in the transition will be closely watched by foreign investors who have expressed concern over timezone differences and consequent trade-matching failures. Supporters of the move say faster settlement reduces counterparty risk and trading costs. The shift will boost operational efficiency as rolling of funds and stocks will be faster, said Suresh Shukla, joint president at Kotak Securities Ltd. The US Securities And Exchange Commission has sought stakeholder views on moving to a one-day settlement cycle and an industry body in Europe is discussing the same. Shortening the settlement cycle should reduce the amount of margin that counterparties would need to post with clearinghouses, SEC Chair Gary Gensler said in the paper.

All five vehicles will be built on a common architecture that borrows heavily from partner Volkswagen's MEB electric vehicle platform. Shah said Mahindra's partnership with VW may take on other forms as it goes forward, without elaborating. Mahindra sells tractors and small off-road vehicles in the United States. A 2010 plan to import the company's diesel-powered Scorpio compact pickups was scuttled before launch."

    "description": "M&M will make investment of approximately Rs 10,000 crore over a period of seven to eight years for setting up the manufacturing unit in Maharashtra's Pune",
    "article": "Auto major   on December 14 announced that it has approved a Rs 10,000 crore investment towards an electric vehicles manufacturing facility in Maharashtra, to be set up under the state governments industrial promotion scheme for EVs. The company will, through a subsidiary, invest around Rs 10,000 crore over a period of seven to eight years to set up the manufacturing facility, and towards development and production of its upcoming Born Electric Vehicle (BEVs), which were showcased in Oxfordshire on August 15. Vehicles proposed to be made at the plant will be based on  's INGLO EV platform and will include e-SUVs under the XUV brand, besides an all-new electric-only brand called BE. Rajesh Jejurikar, Executive Director, Auto & Farm Sectors at M&M, in a media released said the company is delighted with the states approval to set up the plant in Pune and investing in their home state of 70 years. The governments focus on ease-of-doing-business and progressive policies, together with Mahindras investment, will act as a catalyst for Maharashtra to become Indias EV hub, attracting further Indian and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), Jejurikar added. Founded in 1945, M&M employs 260,000 across 100 countries and is the worlds largest tractor company by volume. In September, sources told Reuters that M&M is in talks with global investors to raise between $250 million and $500 million to accelerate its plans to build EVs. \"Mahindra is in early talks with global green funds and private equity firms,\" the person said, adding that it wants a long-term investor who can help build out its EV business. \"Mahindra wants to bring a benchmark investor on board but does not want to dilute a large stake at present,\" he said, adding that these plans are at an early stage and subject to changes. The report came weeks after Mahindra outlined an ambitious plan to launch five electric SUVs over the next few years and is targeting such models to make up 30 percent of its total annual SUV sales by March 2027. Mahindra has partnered with Germany's Volkswagen to procure components like electric drivetrains and batteries for its electric SUVs, and the two are exploring joint vehicle projects, building battery cells locally and developing charging solutions. The automaker has said it is open to making some investments in a battery cell maker to secure future supplies, and is also evaluating the need to set up manufacturing capacity for EVs. At the start of the year, not much was known of Mahindras EV plans, except that the brand intended to continue sticking to its SUV speciality even in the EV space and that it has 16 EV models earmarked for release by 2027. Out of these the XUV400 was announced in September 2022. Notably, despite its early entry in the space with the now discontinued e2o and the e-Verito models, M&M has been noticeably absent as rivals such as Tata Motors gain a lead. However, with a readymade modular EV platform at its disposal, Mahindra could still level the playing field fairly soon despite its delayed arrival in the lithium-ion EV space.

The objective of engaging MDOs through open global tenders is to augment domestic coal production and reduce reliance on import to extent possible. \"Coal India Limited (CIL) has issued letters of acceptance for seven coal projects to be pursued through engagement of Mine Developer and Operators,\" the maharatna firm said in a statement. Of these seven projects, three belong to CIL arm Central Coalfields Ltd (CCL) and two to Mahanadi Coalfields Ltd (MCL)--another subsidiary of CIL. South Eastern Coalfields Ltd and Eastern Coalfield Ltd account for a solitary project each. The coal behemoth is tracking a total of 15 new coal projects to mine coal through MDOs. CIL will invest Rs 20,600 crore on land acquisition, rehabilitation and resettlement issues, and in some cases on railway sidings as well. The role of MDOs would be to excavate, extract and deliver coal to the companies in accordance with the approved mining plan. Ownership of the mines and coal rests with CIL. Sale of coal would be done by CIL. MDOs would bring to the table technology infusion, bulk of the capex investment, economic viability and efficiency in operations for increased production."

    "article": " on January 19 reported a 20.17 percent drop in its consolidated net profit at Rs 2,156 crore. The company had posted a net profit of Rs 2,701 crore in the same quarter last year. The revenue from operations also fell 2.71 percent to Rs 7,628 crore compared to Rs 7,841 crore in the corresponding quarter last year. The drop in revenue was on account of lower LME coinciding with lower refined metal and silver volumes partially offset by favourable exchange rates and gains from strategic hedging. Mined metal production for the quarter was at 254 kilotonnes (kt), marginally up from Q3FY22 driven by higher ore production and marginally down compared to last quarter due to overall mined metal grades. The firm posted the highest-ever nine months mined metal production at 761 kilotonnes, up 5.4 percent YoY, driven by higher ore production, improved mined metal grades and operational efficiency. Zinc production during the quarter was at 210 kt, down 1.7 percent YoY and up 11.3 percent sequentially. Nine months integrated zinc production was at 606 kt, up 7.3 percent YoY, the company said. Silver production for the quarter was at 161 MT, down 6.9 percent YoY owing to lower feed grade at SK Mine in line with the mine plan for the quarter. The Board of the company has also approved a third interim dividend of Rs 13 per equity share. The record date for the dividend payment is January 30. The company said it will also purchase the equity shares of THL Zinc Ltd, Mauritius which comprises shares held in Black Mountain Mining Pty Ltd, South Africa (69.6 percent) and THL Zinc Namibia Holdings (Pty) Ltd (100 percent), Namibia by Hindustan Zinc through its wholly owned subsidiary, for a cash consideration not exceeding $2,981 million in a phased manner. Eventually, THL Zinc Ltd will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. This investment is an attractive opportunity for Hindustan Zinc to grow and increase its foothold overseas and take its brand globally. Hindustan Zinc will have the combined Reserves and Resources of 1000+ million tonnes of ore & 65+ million metric tonnes of metal across India and Africa. THL Zinc Ltd is currently a wholly-owned subsidiary of THL Zinc Ventures Ltd, a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Vedanta Limited."

    "article": "In order to deepen its presence in the electric vehicle (EV) space,   on Monday commenced deliveries of its light commercial vehicle (LCV) Ace EV. A total of 25 Ace EVs were delivered to Amazon, Delhivery, DHL, FedEx, Flipkart, J&J Consumer Health, MoEVing, and Safexpress. The electric E-LCV is priced at an ex-showroom price of Rs 9.99 lakh. The company is also providing a 5-year maintenance package, a dedicated response team, and a charging infrastructure ecosystem. CNBC-TV18 exclusively caught up with Girish Wagh, executive director of Tata Motors. We showcased Ace EV last year and then did multiple pilots for 6 months with courier and e-commerce companies. We tested each and every application and applied the necessary changes. Ace EV is a complete package with charging infrastructure, attractive financing options, and a support centre. This is an important step in decarbonising last-mile and first-mile transportation in urban and semi-urban areas. The demand has been very high and a lot of customer interest is there. Currently, we have 39,000 orders. We are well on track with delivery and will keep on reporting numbers quarterly. We are working on the supply chain to ramp up production. Ace EV will be manufactured at our Pantnagar plant and will utilise the maximum capacity. We already have a good experience in EV platforms. Currently, we have more than 700 e-buses running in several cities across India. We are evaluating segments to study which one is good to electrify. Those platforms with useful applications and usage will be the first ones to have an EV option. Closed-loop applications make sense for EVs and we are working on them. Decarbonisation journey in the CV will be through alternative fuels. The green Hydrogen policy is a wonderful step taken by the government which will surely help India towards the 2070 target. We are working on ethanol flex-fuel and fuel cell technology apart from EVs. We have currently got an order from Indian Oil for fuel cell E-Buses, certain prototypes are being tested in Gujarat. We are seeing a good demand coming back after 2.5 years after COVID-19. The transporters are positive and optimistic and driving demand. Maximum growth is seen in buses this year mainly due to the low base. Quarterly the bus growth might look low in QoQ comparison, but the full-year growth will be higher YoY. Demand growth will continue in the medium and heavy CV segment. Light commercial vehicle demand dipped majorly during Covid and now the demand is gradually increasing. Overall, demand is likely to be majorly aided by the bus segment. The government has been supportive and more than a catalyst to create EV demand. Schemes like FAME and the recent PLIs related EV sector are a boost. We expect current support to continue till EV crosses the threshold. We want current measures and policies for EVs to continue. Ace EV is the first E-LCV product powered by EVOGEN powertrain that offers a driving range of 154 kilometers on a single charge. Ace EV has a 27kW motor that generates 130Nm of peak torque. The LCV has been launched in Delhi, Pune, and Mumbai and will be soon launched in Bengaluru, and Chennai followed by 5 other cities."

    "article": " chief CP Gurnani wants to transition from being a long serving captain in the IT industry to a \"coach\" after he retires from the company in December this year. The nomination and remuneration committee has extended the tenure of Gurnani till December 19, 2023 as it looks to work on the succession plan of Gurnani. While he did not divulge any further details on the succession plan, sources have indicated that internal candidates -- Jagdish Mitra, Manish Vyas, Lakshmanan Chidambaram are among top contenders for the post. Jagdish Mitra is currently serving as Chief Strategy Officer and Head of Growth, who has been with the group for last 30 years; Vyas is serving as President, Communications, Media and Entertainment Business, and CEO, Network Services and been with the company for last 23 years and Chidambaram, currently serving as President for Tech Mahindra Americas and been with company since December 2012. Gurnani said that the succession plan will be finalised by the committee as per the corporate governance norms of the company. \"I've done the same business for a very long time. I became a CXO at the age of 38 and am now stepping down at the age of 65. All I'm trying to say is that I've been a playing captain for a very long time. I will become a coach. I will no longer be a playing captain,\" Gurnani said. One of the longest serving CEOs in the technology sector, Gurnani told PTI that would like to see the other side of the world and pursue things that are close to his heart. \"I have been one of the longest serving CEOs of the technology sector. I think it is fair that I get to see what the other side of the world looks like and I'm not talking about travel. I'm talking about a few things that I've always wanted to do in life. It is also good for the corporation that we get a new leader because a bit of rotation is like getting more oxygen into the system,\" Gurnani said. While talking about business, Gurnani said Tech Mahindra will continue to deepen its presence in Japan and Europe and look at opening delivery centres closer to the home of its employees. \"I have always been a very big admirer of Japan, I will continue to create much deeper business interest in Japan. Frankly, I think Europe is a big opportunity now. Because overall Europe has felt the impact of the war. \"The war has been closest to them. Every individual in Europe has paid a price by inflation and higher energy bills. I believe that some of our cost transformation initiatives would be very helpful to European clients. So, my focus will be Japan and Europe,\" he said. Gurnani said that the technology sector has matured and they have continued to serve their consumers, businesses, enterprises and corporates around the world by not taking a position. \"The only area where there has been some conversations is there organizations which are using cyber attacks as a weapon,\" Gurnani said but declined to reveal further details. When asked about a broad strategic action plan that the company is planning to put in place this year, Gurani said that Tech Mahindra will look at distributing delivery centres across the country and near to the homes of its employees. \"We continue to make technological investments in the future of technology. Right now it is AI, cloud, metaverse and we have already started investing in quantum computing. We want to be ahead of the curve. There are some of our products which I think will be able to commercialize them a lot better,\" Gurnani said."

    "article": " expects elevated capital expenditure on automation to continue for three more years, a senior official has said. The city-headquartered company started its investment journey on the automation front two years ago and has already been recognised for its work by multiple bodies, Geena Malhotra, the chief technology officer for the company, told PTI recently. The World Economic Forum (WEF) has recognised one of its four manufacturing units as a 'lighthouse' project for being replicated across the world, Malhotra said, adding that the company will be implementing the same across all of its 42 plants. \"On investments, we have done both regular capital expenditure and also additional investments. We have made a good amount of investments in the last two years and will be investing for about 3-4 years more in this journey,\" Malhotra said. The company, however, did not disclose the financial details of its automation spends. The journey on automation has its roots in a decision Cipla took in 2020, where it started with reimagining technology and making it more cost-effective, Malhotra said, adding that it wanted to align closely with the organisation's view of how it sees itself ten years down the line. The aim at the organisation level is to \"produce high quality products which comply with sustainability goals, which are affordable and leave the planet safer\", she said, adding that the 3 Rs of repeatability, reliability and resilience are its guiding force in this journey. It had already adopted inputs like robotics in manufacturing, but automation was one step ahead, Malhotra said, pointing out that under the new paradigm, jobs like assigning work to employees at the plant are also decided by the system. Earlier, it used to take manual intervention to assign work for every employee in a factory, whereas now with the implementation of some solutions, there is a screen indicating who needs to do what, the tools to be used for the work, etc. This ensures a highly efficient workforce by increasing productivity, she explained. \"Our work on the automation side has helped us save power, be more sustainable and reduce greenhouse gas emissions,\" Malhotra said. \"We have moved from being predictive to prescriptive in our automation journey and the aspiration is to be fully autonomous at the end of the investment cycle,\" Malhotra added. A manufacturing facility generates a lot of data, which, if studied properly, can throw up insights which can help a great deal for a unit, she said, conceding that a lot of aspects on the technology front were new for the company. \"We hired consultants to help us hire for specialised jobs like data scientists, which was new for a pharma major like us. Simultaneously, we also invested in upskilling our existing workforce,\" she said. Helping the company through the journey has been US-based company Rockwell Automation. Its regional director for the India market Dilip Sawhney said life sciences is one of the key focus areas for the company."

We reiterate our Buy recommendation on Britannia Industries Limited (Britannia) with a revised price target of Rs. 5,060.

In terms of verticals, manufacturing (17.5% of mix) led growth with 10.6% q-o-q growth while BFSI (37.4% of mix) and CPG & Retail (15.2% of the mix) grew 5.8% and 1.1%, respectively.

LTM attrition declined by 180 bps q-o-q to 22.3%. In the quarter the company had a robust order inflow of $1.25 billion. The company also stated that it has a healthy pipeline ahead and continues to see large deals in the market. Management expects synergy benefits of US$1 bn and margin expansion of 200 to 300 bps over the next four to five years. We expect the outlook for FY24 to be uncertain on account of global headwinds and any recovery is most likely to be gradual. Post-merger, LTIMindtree is well placed to provide cross-sell and up sell opportunities and reap significant revenue and cost synergies over the longer term .Hence, we maintain a Buy rating on LTIMindtree with revised PT of Rs. 4965 despite the muted results in a seasonally weak quarter.

The management aims to capitalize DSP, which commands great brand equity, in several parts of India. Material cost outlook remains challenging in the near term. Neither glass costs nor ENA are showing signs of abating in the near term but FY24 outlook is likely to be better. Natural gas costs are rising, which would hurt glass costsfor now.

    "article": "IPRU Life reported a decent 9MFY23 financial performance, led by positive surprise on VNB margin at 32% (vs our estimate of 30.6%) that gave Management the confidence to reiterate doubling of FY19 absolute VNB in FY23. Absolute VNB reported growth of 23.2% YoY for 9MFY23 at Rs17.1bn, driven by strong VNB margin (+4.9ppts YoY) and moderate APE growth (+4% YoY), beating our estimate by 5%. The sharp increase in margin is owing to increase in Non-Par saving, Annuity and Protection products in the product mix. Retail protection appears to be finally turning the corner, with Q3FY23 Retail protection APE rising sequentially and also exceeding Q4FY22 levels. On the distribution front, all channels, except ICICI Bank, are clocking satisfactory-to-strong performance. ICICI Banks share in the APE mix has gone down to ~18% in 9MFY23, but decline in the channel APE persists. Net net, developments in VNB margin, retail protection, non-ICICI Bank channel distribution and persistency afford increased confidence to the company, and the FY24 APE growth outlook holds the key for IPRU shares. Management appears positive about FY24 growth prospects, on grounds of the robust growth performance in agency and ex-ICICI Bank banca partnerships as well as the declining impact of ICICI Bank channel de-growth. Accounting for the developments in 9MFY23, we marginally tweak our FY23-25 estimates and reiterate our BUY rating, with our Dec-23E Target Price remaining unchanged at Rs605/share, implying FY24E P/EV of 2.1x. Post their underperformance over the past few years, IPRU shares are now valued at FY24E P/EV of 1.7x  still meaningfully undervalued versus peers and own history, and likely reflecting the negativity of the poor top-line growth and the muted expectation being already in the price. With the valuation relatively undemanding, we expect IPRU shares to re-rate, once top-line growth returns. "

    "description": "Three other Indian banks also put money on the table for the acquisition of the Griffin Coal mine by Lanco, which went bankrupt. The loans turned bad in 2017 and ICICI Bank is learned to have fully provided for the losses in FY18.",
    "article": "When large-scale corporate loan write-offs have come under scrutiny in India, one such sorry saga by an Indian bank is getting a lot of attention in Australia. An $850 million (around Rs 6,919 crores at current dollar prices) loan advanced in tranches to Indias   by   since 2010 when Chanda Kochhar was at the helm turned bad in 2017. The funds were lent to Lanco for the acquisition of the Griffin Coal mine in Western Australia. Since then, the lenders are technically stuck with effective ownership of the lossmaking mine, having acquired pledged shares, and are reportedly silent on ceding control,  . The Griffin mine supplies coal to the Bluewaters Power station in Western Australia. Bluewaters is owned by Japanesepower utility Kansai Electric and global trading company Sumitomo Corp., according to its website. The total amount lent by the banks in the consortiumincluding  ,   and Exim Bankworks out to about $1.4 billion (around Rs 11,396 crore at current prices), according to people familiar with the developments. Among them, ICICI Bank has a relatively significant exposure to the failed mine. According to Australian media reports, ICICI Banks loans to Lanco for the Griffin buyout stood at $1.1 billion (around Rs 8954 crore at current prices) at one point, after initially lending $750 million (around Rs 6,105 crore at current prices). The banks exposure to Griffin at this point is about $850 million, apersonin the know told on condition of anonymity. This became a non-performing asset (NPA) in 2017 and was fully provided for during FY18, theperson said. This is one of the loans that went wrong for the bank, said the person quoted above. It became an NPA in 2017-18 and ICICI Bank has fully provided for it.The entire exposure to Lanco is provided for. Emails sent to ICICI Bank, Bank of Baroda, Indian Overseas Bank, and Exim Bank requesting comments on the matter remained unanswered. A separate email sent to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) asking whether the regulator has looked into the matter was unanswered. How did ICICI Bank and the other lenders get dragged into the deal? To be sure, it wasnt ICICI Bank alone that sought a slice of the pie of risky corporate loans in 2010. Most Indian banks were upbeat at that time on the global energy story and wanted a share of it. ICICI Bank was no exception. Additionally for ICICI Bank, the Lanco loan was granted at about the time the bank took a Rs 3,250 crore disastrous bet on the Videocon Group back home, under its former chief Kochhar. This loan was allegedly part of a quid pro quo deal between the Kochhar family and Videocons Venugopal Dhoot, according to later probes. ICICI Banks funding enabled Lanco to try its luck in the tricky Australian coal mine business. Using the loan money, Lanco acquired Griffin Coal in 2011 through its Australian subsidiary.According to Lancos website, Griffin was the largest individual supplier of thermal coal to Western Australia's industrial coal market with over 1.2 billion tonnes of coal resources. The bet went wrong in all possible waysfor the buyer and the financiers. In the years that followed, production at Griffin was less than optimal and Lanco reeled under a huge debt burden back home that would ultimately push the group to bankruptcy. Lancos woes doubled in August 2018, when the Indian bankruptcy court ordered the liquidation of  , the groups holding company. . This raised the question of the efficiency of ICICI Banks due diligence process when it ascertained the creditworthiness of the borrower. To cut a long story short, it isnt an exaggeration to say that the coal mine turned out to be a white elephant for Lanco and its lenders. Lanco finally hit a wall in 2017, when lenders took over the shares pledged against the loan after the company defaulted on payments, effectively taking ownership of the failed mine.  a Lanco official as saying in December 2017 that Griffin coal was no longer a subsidiary of the group after the lenders took over the pledged shares. However, for the lenders, the damage was already done. It had to tag the funding for Lancos misadventure as an NPA and provide for it. A loan becomes an NPA if there is no repayment of interest or principal for 90 days. Provisions refer to money set aside to cover potential losses. An important question at this stage is whether ICICI Bank and the other lenders own the failed mine now. . The reports suggest that lenders are now pushing for higher coal prices that could cause a commensurate increase for consumers in Western Australia, which faced a growing energy crisis. Despite the banks continued silence on its plans for the operation, it is understood ICICI is pushing for big increases to the price Griffin receives for its coal, the report said. Reportedly, the Australian authorities are in talks with the lenders on this issue. However, the person quoted above denied the lenders ownership of the mine. The bank doesnt have the ownership. Bluewaters Power wants the bankto take the ownership, theperson said. couldnt independently verify this claim. There is only hope left at this point. The bank expects that the Australian governments efforts to revive the failed Griffin coal mine will help to improve cashflows and enable some writeback of the provisions made. If any money comes back,the bank is happy, the person said. But, according to ABC News, the mining lease of Griffin will expire in July and the Australian authorities need to be convinced of the owners financial capability. That will be another challenge for the lenders. The Lanco loan is only one of many huge corporate loan bets that have gone wrong with Indian banks since 2010. When such loans were not repaid, banks resorted to large-scale corporate write-offs as part of a massive book-cleaning exercise started in 2015 by former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan. Indias scheduled commercial banks wrote off loans of over Rs 10 lakh crore ($121 billion) during the past five financial years, according to data submitted by the government in Parliament. A loan is written off when there is no scope of recovery and banks want to take the bad asset off their balance sheets. But this exercise comes at a cost to the bank. The provisions made on such loans affect their profitability.Thats not good news for shareholders and investors. Recovery from such loans is always insignificant.Public sector banks could recover only about Rs 1 lakh crore from the written-off loans over the past financial years."
