            'with thermal and renewable energy posting a growth in generation '
            'of 2.5 percent and 8.5 percent, respectively, on a YoY basis. '
            'According to a report from Emkay Research, coal production '

            'at 24MT, which is up 2.4x since clocking 10MT in Sep-21, when a '

            'During Q2FY23, generation for NTPC (standalone) grew by ~9 '

{'article': ' on May 12 reported a consolidated net loss of Rs 1,032 crore for '
            'the quarter ended March as against a consolidated net loss of Rs '
            '7,605 crore in the year-ago quarter. The company reported an '
            '11.5percent year-on-year decline in consolidated revenue from '
            'operations to Rs 78,439 crore for the reported quarter. Analysts '
            'had expected the company to report a consolidated net profit ofRs '
            '12.8 crore on revenues of Rs 82,386 crore. The weakness in the '
            'performance of the company waslargely down to subsidiary Jaguar '
            'Land Rover, whose revenues in the reported quarter nosedived 27.1 '
            'per cent year-on-year to 4.8 billion pound sterling. The weakness '
            "in the revenues of JLR was down to the company's inability to "
            'secure semi-conductors to ramp up production while disruption in '
            'the European and China business also weighed. "The environment '
            'remains difficult in light of the global chip shortage and other '
            'challenges. However, Im encouraged by the continuing strong '
            'customer demand for our products, highlighted by a record order '
            'book," Thierry Bollore, chief executive officer of JLR said in an '
            'earningsstatement. JLR said that the semi-conductorshortage will '
            'continue through out 2022 even though there might be some '
            'improvement. "However, the Covid lockdowns in China as well as '
            'the new Range Rover Sport model changeover are expected to limit '
            'volume improvements in Q1 possibly resulting in negative EBIT and '
            'negative free cash flows in the quarter," JLR said. That said, '
            'JLR reported 340 million pound sterling in free cash flow in the '
            'March quarter and 1.2 billion pounds for the full financial year. '
            'JLR also took an exceptional charge of 43 million pounds on its '
            'business in Russia, which was affected by the Russia-Ukraine war. '
            'Operatingperformance of JLR suffered in light of higher costs as '
            'operating margin shrank 270 basis points on-year to 12.6 percent '
            'in the reported quarter. At the same time, the India business of '
            'the company continued to perform well as revenues in the '
            'commercial vehicle segment jumped 29.3 percent and in the '
            'passenger vehicle vertical rose 62 percent on-year. "The Indian '
            'Commercial Vehicles sector, deeply impacted for two successive '
            'years, showed promising signs of growth in FY22 supported by a '
            'steady recovery in the economy, rising industrial activity and '
            'reopening of markets," said Girish Wagh, executive director at '
            'Tata Motors. In passenger vehicles, the company will continue to '
            'drive strong sales performance whilst improving profitability and '
            'managing supply bottlenecks. In electric vehicles, the business '
            'will drive up penetration and accelerate sales further, Tata '
            'Motors said. That said, the operating performance of the '
            'CVbusiness was impacted by higher fuel and commodity costs for '
            'the company. The operating margin of the CV business shrank 290 '
            'basis points on-year to 5.9 percent in the reported quarter. '
            'However, price hikes in the passenger vehicle segment helped that '
            'vertical to expand its operating margin by 190 basis points '
            'on-year to 6.9 percent. "We remain agile and will continue to '

            'the June FY23 quarter grew by 109 percent YoY to Rs 13,723 crore '
            'and sequentially 29.5 percent. "This increase in revenue was '
            'aided by an increase in PPA (power purchase agreement) tariffs '
            'due to higher import coal prices and greater alternate coal '
            'usage, improved merchant and short-term tariffs, the revival of '
            '1,234 MW bid-2 PPA with Gujarat discoms, and higher prior period '
            'revenue recognition," Adani Power said in its BSE filing.  The '
            'company said the revenue for the June quarter included '
            'recognition of prior period revenue from operations of Rs 2,561 '
            'crore, and prior period other income of Rs 1,651 crore, primarily '
            'on account of various regulatory orders. The corresponding '
            'amounts of prior period revenue recognition for Q1 FY2021-22 were '
            'Rs 125 crore and Rs 532 crore, respectively. On the operating '
            'front, the company registered a 247 percent year-on-year growth '
            'in EBITDA at Rs 5,720 crore and sequential growth of 9.3 percent. '
            '"EBITDA growth was aided by prior period income recognition, '
            'improved tariff realisation, and change in sales mix, partially '
            'offset by the impact of higher fuel cost, increased operating '
            'expenses owing to the acquisition of Mahan Energen Ltd, '
            'unfavourable foreign exchange movement, etc," Adani Power said. ',

            'the previous rulings" in its favor. Fiat Chrysler\'s parent '
            'company Stellantis NV declined to comment on the decision. Fiat '
            'Chrysler sued Mahindra in Michigan court and at the U.S. '
            'International Trade Commission in 2018 over its Roxor design, '
            'arguing it copied trademark-protected elements of its Jeeps. A '
            'Detroit federal court blocked Mahindra from selling pre-2020 '
            'Roxors, but rejected its bid to block sales of its redesigned '
            'version of the off-road-only vehicle. U.S. District Judge '
            "Gershwin Drain's decision was based on an ITC ruling that the "
            "Roxor did not infringe Fiat Chrysler's trademark rights because "
            'the average person would "know immediately" from looking at it '
            'that it is not a Jeep. But the 6th Circuit said Monday that the '
            'court should have held Mahindra to a higher standard because it '
            "was already a known infringer. Mahindra's new design was required "
            'to keep a "safe distance" from Jeep designs, U.S. Circuit Judge '
            'Helene White wrote for a three-judge panel. "Because a court can '

            'June 30, 2022. The company had reported a consolidated net profit '
            'of Rs 5,904 crore in the year-ago period. Sequentially, the '
            'profit was 74 percent down from Rs 3,234. After adjusting '
            'exceptional expense of Rs 741 crore, the consolidated profit for '
            'the last quarter of FY22 stood at Rs 3,975 crore. Consolidated '
            'revenue climbed31.8 percent year-on-year to Rs 38,086 crore as '
            'compared to net revenue of Rs 28,902 crore. On a sequential '

            'Rs 46,895 crore recorded in the previous quarter, which was also '
            'the highest revenue generation by the company in a quarter. '
            'During the reported quarter, high inflation across major '
            'economies on the back of supply chain disruptions and the '
            'Russia-Ukraine conflict had impacted the global economic '
            'outlook," the company said in its earnings release. High '
            'inflation and policy rate tightening across the world have become '
            'formidable headwinds. The company said the domestic steel '
            'industry was affected by falling global prices and the imposition '
            'of a 15 percent duty on certain steel exports in May further '
            'exacerbated the situation with a steep fall of 26 percent in '
            'exports QoQ. The consolidated India operations of the company '
            'produced 5.72 MT (million tons) of steel during the quarter but '
            'sales volume stood at 4.45 MT. The companys American subsidiary, '
            'JSW Steel USA, produced 0.16 MT of steel during the quarter and '
            'managed to sell its entire production. The rise in the cost of '
            'raw materials, power and fuel costs and other expenses severely '
            'dented the margins . The company could achieve an EBITDA '
            '(earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) of '
            'Rs 4,309 crore, which was down 58 percent from Rs 10,274 crore in '
            'the year-ago period. On a sequential basis, the EBITDA declined '
            '53 percent. Consequently, EBITDA margins for the quarter at 11 '
            'percent were 25 percent lower than the 36 percent recorded in '
            'year-ago quarter and 9 percent down from the March quarter. The '
            'net margins for the June quarter stood at 2.2 percent compared to '
            '20.4 percent during the same period last year and 7.1 percent '
            "during the March quarter. The company's consolidated net gearing "
            '(net debt to equity) stood at 0.98x at the end of the quarter (as '
            'against 0.83x at the end of Q4 FY22), and net debt to EBITDA '
            'stood at 2.03x (as against 1.4Sx at the end of Q4 FY22). A '
            'significant portion of the increase in debt due to the locking up '
            'of working capital in inventory. The capex spend during the '
            'quarter stood at Rs 3,702 crore against the planned capex spend '
            'of Rs 20,000 crore for FY23. Considering the current market '
            'conditions, the company expects to calibrate its capex spend to '
            'Rs 15,000 crores for FY23," it said. Its expansion projects are '

            'the weakest quarter for steel companies as construction activity '
            'across the country gets stalled due to the monsoon, dampening '
            'demand. But the situation this time was further aggravated by the '

            'and slight improvement in sentiments in China, owing to targeted '
            'stimulus, though in smaller quantities, the report added. Steel '
            'HRC spot prices ex-Mumbai are currently at Rs 56,500 per tonne, '
            'down 25 percent from the peak of the first week of April 2022. '

            '17 percent q-o-q and 14 percent on-year to Rs 57,027 per tonne. '
            'In Q1FY23, the sales volumes were impacted due to destocking by '
            'traders as they expected the steel prices to fall as well as in '
            'light of the onset of the monsoon, said the analysts at Axis '
            'Securities. However, in Q2FY23, they foresee steel sales volumes '
            'reviving as traders are restocking to serve the demand from the '
            'post-monsoon pick-up in construction activity as well as the '
            'upcoming festive season demand. There was also some respite as '
            'prices of key inputs softened slightly.   (NMDC) had reduced iron '
            'ore prices by Rs 500 per tonne in July. This was on top of the '
            'massive cut of Rs 1,850 per tonne it effected during the May-June '
            'period. The prices were revised upwards by around Rs 100 per '
            'tonne in August with no change in September. Coking coal prices '
            'have, however, continued to slide and witnessed a correction of '
            'about $50-60 per tonne. But the thermal coal prices remained '

            'of South African coal to partly compensate for Russian '
            'coal/natural gas supplies that are under sanctions. The full '
            'benefit of the decline in input costs will, however, come be seen '

            'to post volumes growth in the range of 7-17 percent on a q-o-q '
            'basis. Overall, the analysts at Elara Capital expect EBITDA '

            'per tonne for steel firms under their coverage universe to '
            'contract in the range of Rs 12,500-21,000 on an annualised basis '
            'and Rs 4,500-15,000 q-o-q. Base metal companies are expected to '
            'be severely impacted by falling commodity prices as well as the '

            'On the London Metals Exchange, all base metals witnessed a '

            'percent, aluminium 18 percent, zinc 17 percent, nickel 24 percent '
            'and lead 10 percent. The correction is driven by a global drop in '

            'fall at a relatively slower rate aided by past hedging and a 3 '
            'percent depreciation in the rupee. Volumes for most companies are '
            'expected to remain flattish while cost of production is expected '

            'percent from Rs 2,461 crore earned in the January-March period. '
            'The company beat the streets estimates for both the profit as '
            'well as its consolidated revenues. The volumes witnessed strong '
            'traction over the low base of last year and the price hikes taken '
            'by the company enabled improvement in realisations which fuelled '
            'revenue growth. However, the profitability got impacted by the '
            'rise in power and fuel costs. Sequentially, the demand was '
            'impacted due to a moderation in demand from the real estate '
            'sector forhigher commodity prices. After a strong end to FY22, '
            'cement demand was impacted by overall inflationary trends and '
            'lower labour availability in May 2022, however, cement demand '
            'picked up in June 2022 on pre-monsoon construction activity, the '
            'company said in its earnings release. While headwinds arising out '
            'of rising cost pressure could put some pressure on the '
            'profitability of cement companies, the strong momentum in housing '
            'and given the governments thrust on infrastructure and industrial '

            'upswing in demand in FY23, the company said in its earnings '
            'release. The consolidated revenues for the Aditya Birla Group '
            'flagship company rose28.2 percent on-year to Rs15,164 crore from '
            'Rs 11,830 crore. On a sequential basis, the revenue is marginally '
            'lower by3.8 percent from the revenue of Rs 15,767 crore recorded '
            'in the previous quarter. The other income for the quarter was '
            'lower by 47 percent at Rs 108.7 crore as compared to Rs 205 crore '
            'during the corresponding period last year. The other income '
            'during the previous quarter was marginally lower at Rs 92.4 '
            'crore. The rise in the pet coke and crude prices resulted in a '
            'significant surge in the power & fuel cost for the company which '
            'jumped 595 bps (100 basis points =1 percent) compared to the year '
            'ago period to 26.5 percent as percentage of revenue. Compared to '
            'the previous quarter, the power & fuel cost is higher by 130 bps. '
            'Other expenses also witnessed a marginal increase of 24 bps over '
            'the last year period to 12.2 percent of total revenue. However, '
            'the company could save on the costs of employees and freight & '
            'forwarding costs which declined 74 bps and 69 bps respectively '
            'over the same period last year. Sequentially however, the '
            'employee cost as percent of revenue increased marginally by 22 '
            'bps while freight was down 36 bps. The cost of raw materials was '
            'stable at around 13 percent of revenues. PBIDT (profit before '

            'was lower by 8.8 percent on year while on a sequential basis '

            'on lower revenue and operating income, but on-year basis, the '
            'growth would be more than 250 percent due to low base. The June '
            '2021 quarter was affected by the emergence of the second wave of '
            'COVID-19, which forced several states to announce lockdowns. The '
            'Nifty Auto index is at a new high, but Maruti Suzuki is yet to '
            'achieve that milestone. The Maruti Suzuki stock has gained nearly '
            '13 percent in the current financial year, compared to a 16 '

            'selling pressure in the last two days, ahead of quarterly '
            'earnings which will be announced on July 27. Revenue is likely to '
            'fall in the range of 1-3 percent sequentially for the quarter '
            'supported by price hikes taken by the company and impacted by '
            'lower volumes, but the year-on-year (YoY) growth could be more '
            'than 45 percent, as per brokerage houses. Maruti Suzuki sold more '
            'than 4.67 lakh vehicles in the quarter ended June 2022, '
            'registering a 4.3 percent sequential decline, but 32.3 percent '
            'YoY increase. "We expect revenues to decline by 3 percent QoQ led '
            'by 4 percent QoQ decline in volumes, and 1.5 percent QoQ increase '
            'in average selling price (ASPs) due to price hikes taken over the '
            'last quarter in Q1FY23," said Kotak Institutional Equities, which '
            'sees 265 percent YoY growth and 12.5 percent sequential decline '

            'QoQ amid 4.3 percent QoQ de-growth in volumes and sequential rise '
            'in ASPs. The operating profit is likely to decline QoQ on account '

            'was support from price hikes and yen depreciation against the '
            'Indian rupee. "We estimate EBITDA margin to decline by 50 bps QoQ '
            'led by raw material headwinds and higher marketing spends due to '

            'denominated) in Q1FY23," said Kotak, which sees EBITDA falling '
            '8.2 percent QoQ and increasing 172 percent YoY. "Gross margin is '
            'expected to contract due to higher input costs. EBITDA margin may '

            'environment, Wipro Chief Executive Officer Thierry Delaporte said '
            'that in the last quarter, macroeconomic conditions across almost '
            'all markets and sectors have changed. In speaking to our clients '
            'every day, we are seeing a change in the level of optimism as '
            'businesses around the world are dealing with inflationary '
            'pressures, geopolitical turmoil, energy crisis and rising '
            'interest rates. Almost every major economy is experiencing today '
            "economic deceleration, it's a fact, he said. There is a certain "
            'level of uncertainty, he cautioned. He said that while clients '
            'are not saying that they are cutting spends on technology, they '
            'are talking about a level of uncertainty. However, Delaporte '
            'affirmed that he believes there is currently no slowdown in '
            'demand. Our pipeline is not lower, projection of bookings for the '
            'coming quarter are actually strong, Delaporte added. He added '
            'that it is difficult to quantify if there if the decision-making '
            'of clients has slowed. Are we seeing it sometimes? Yes. I believe '
            "large technology companies are slowing down. It's a reality. We "
            'see that in some pockets. Is it widespread? Too early to tell, '
            'honestly. We stay vigilant. Hence, maybe this caution, he said. '
            'As we are looking at Q3, we reflect on this level of uncertainty. '
            'You might feel that we are slightly cautious but I think we are '
            'acknowledging the fact that we are in a time of more uncertainty, '
            'that the market has changed compared to a year ago, he added. For '
            'the next quarter, Wipros revenue growth guidance on a sequential '
            'basis is at 0.5-2 percent. On the issue of discretionary spending '
            'by clients, Delaporte said several clients are making two '
            'budgets, one more cautious than the other, but they do not know '
            "what the outcome for the 2023 calendar year will be. It's too "

            'deals that focus on productivity, on cost rationalisation, vendor '
            'consolidation, and so on. We possibly see that more than we would '
            'have seen it a year ago, he added. Delaporte added that the '
            'nature of deals is shifting, but not in the number of bookings. '
            'Commenting on the present pricing environment, the CEO said they '
            'have been able to discuss a price increase with a relatively '

{'article': ' (ITC), on May 18, reported an 11.7 percent growth in '
            'consolidated net profit at Rs 4,196 crore for the fourth quarter '
            'of FY2021-22 as against Rs 3,755 crore recorded a year ago. On a '
            'sequential basis, the profit has inched up 3.4 percent from Rs '
            '4,057 crore earned during the OctoberDecember period. '
            'Consolidated revenue for the largest cigarette maker in India '
            'rose 15.3 percent on-year to Rs 17,754 crore as compared to a '
            'revenue of Rs 15,404 crore registered in the year-ago quarter. On '
            'a sequential basis, the revenue was down 3.3 percent from the '
            'revenue of Rs 18,366 crore recorded in the previous quarter. For '
            'the full year period from April  March 2022, the consolidated PAT '
            'witnessed a growth of 15.8 percent to Rs 15,243 crore from the '
            'profit of Rs 13,161 crore achieved during FY21. Consolidated '
            'revenues for FY22 jumped 22.7 percent to Rs 65,205 crore from the '
            'revenues of Rs 53,155 crore for last year. Net of excise, the '
            'revenues for the quarter came in at Rs 16,556 crore, a growth of '
            '12.8 percent on year and a dip of 4.7 percent on quarter. For the '
            'full year period, the net revenues were recorded at Rs 60,668 '
            'crore, a growth of 16.9 percent over FY21. The performance was '
            'driven by healthy growth across its business of cigarettes (both '
            'volume and price increase), FMCG, Hotels and Paperboards and '
            'agri-business. "ITC has beaten all the market estimates and '
            'growth can be seen in all the businesses from cigarettes to FMCG, '
            'Hotels to Paperboards and agri-business", saidRahul Sharma, '
            'Research Head at Equity 99. "The Sales growth, revenue, EBIDTA, '
            'all numbers are above expectationsand the results of strategy '
            'reset by Chairman Sanjiv Puri is now visible across verticals", '
            'added Sharma. The business segment generated revenues of Rs 4,149 '
            'crore for the quarter as compared to Rs 3,694 crore in the '
            'corresponding quarter last year, registering an on year growth of '
            '12.3 percent. EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation '
            'and amortization) for the business came in at Rs 238.47 crore '
            'compared to Rs 183 crore in the year ago period. The business was '
            'able to improve the EBITDA margins by 75 bps YoY to 9 percent '
            'despite inflationary headwinds. The FMCG business, despite '
            'unprecedented increase in prices of key inputs, performed well '
            'through focused cost management interventions across the value '
            'chain, premiumisation, product mix enrichment and judicious '
            'pricing actions, the company said. The Company executed over 110 '
            'new product launches across target markets. The revenues from the '
            'Cigarette business grew by 10 percent on year to Rs 7,177 crore '
            'while sequential growth came in at 3 percent. EBITDA for the '
            'quarter was registered at Rs 4,357 crore compared to Rs 3,895 '
            'crore in the year ago period. The cigarette volume for the '
            'company have now reached the pre-pandemic levels. The revenue for '
            'the business jumped 29 percent on year to Rs 4,375 crore but on a '
            'sequential basis, there was a decline of 15 percent in the '
            'revenues of the business. The growth was driven by wheat, rice, '
            'leaf tobacco exports leveraging strong customer relationships, '
            'investments in sustainable value chains, robust sourcing network '
            'and agile execution, the company said in its release. EBITDA for '
            'the segment grew 30 percent on year to Rs 244 crore but declined '
            '30 percent from the previous quarter. Hotel revenues jumped 35 '
            'percent on year to Rs 407 crore for the quarter. The omicron wave '
            'impacted the performance of the business as it witnessed a '
            'sequential decline of 18 percent in the revenues. Consequently '
            'the business incurred a loss of Rs 29 crore at EBITDA level '
            'compared to a loss of Rs 40 crore during the same quarter last '
            'year. The business had an EBITDA of Rs 53 crore in the quarter '
            'ended December 2021. There was sequential improvement in ARRs '
            '(average room rates); however, remain below pre-pandemic levels, '
            'the company said in its release. Domestic leisure and wedding '
            'segments drive recovery; progressive improvement in business '
            'travel; nascent revival of international travel. The business '
            'delivered strong performance with its revenues growing by 32 '
            'percent on year to Rs 2,183 crore. The sequential growth was 7 '
            'percent. EBITDA for the business jumped 39 percent on year to Rs '
            '450 crore, but was flat on a sequential basis. Paperboard volumes '
            'were at record high aided by demand revival across most end-user '
            'segments, the company said. It continued to scale up its '
            'sustainable products portfolio. Integrated business model, '
            'Digital & Industry 4.0 initiatives and proactive strategic '
            'interventions enable margin expansion amidst commodity price '
            'escalation. Net cash generation from operations stood at over Rs '
            '13,000 crores, a growth of 32 percent year on year. The company '
            'recommended a final dividend of Rs 6.25 per ordinary share of 1/- '
            'each for the financial year ended March 31, 2022 and will be paid '
            'between Friday, 22nd July, 2022 and Tuesday, 26th July, 2022 to '
            'the eligible shareholders. The record date for the payment of '
            'dividend has been fixed as May 28, 2022. "The stock has been '
            'performing well even in the bear market and such results will '
            'take it to new high", added Sharma. ITC stock ended Rs 2.1 higher '

            'its ability to expand the customer base in the face of multiple '
            'external headwindssuch as a steep surge in vehicle prices, supply '
            'chain constraints, a weak customer sentiment, and limited volume '
            'growth visibility. The company recorded an average contraction in '
            'volume growth of 13 percent through FY19to FY22. " Most of these '
            'challenges are now starting to recede with correction in '
            'commodity prices, strong pickup in export sales, improving '
            'customer sentiment in urban and rural markets and the launch of '

            'its recently launched Royal Enfield brand Hunter 350. Footfall '
            'and enquiries were up 15-20percent during August 2022 with '

            'demand momentum to rise further during the upcoming festive '
            'season. Brokerage firm Sharekhan believes Hunter 350 to boost '
            'Royal Enfields volumes and comprise 13-15percent of the brands '
            'bikes in the medium term. "With the improvement in underlying '
            'demand sentiment and product interventions, we believe the '

            '21percent). Softening commodity prices and positive operating '
            'leverage is expected to provide margin support (+540bps over FY '
            '22-25). We reinstate PE multiple for RE to 25x (from 18x)," the '

            "stock's rating to 'buy' with a revised target price of Rs 3,900. "
            'Analyst said the firm is well-poised to recover strongly and put '

            'and production increases, those vehicles can be immediately sent '

{'article': 'The Indian economy has shown remarkable resilience in FY23, with '
            'an uptick visible in most high-frequency indicators. A pick-up in '
            'urban demand and rural demand, too, poised to move up on the back '
            'of a normal monsoon are adding to the positive sentiment. A full '

            'public transport systems like air, rail and bus now fully '
            'operational point to a resilient recovery in economic activity. '
            'Remittances (a major contributor to rural incomes) are likely to '
            'return to pre-pandemic levels with the pick-up in the services '
            'sector. Easing supply chain conditions and easing commodity '
            'prices have partially offset anxieties over worryingly high '
            'levels of inflation. In this context, the market narrative has '
            'shifted from inflation concerns to a cool-off in inflation '
            'expectations in the next one or two quarters. Based on the above '
            'themes, Axis Securities recommends the following stocks that are '
            'well-placed to benefit from robust festival season demand: Maruti '
            'Suzuki India is the market leader in the domestic passenger car '
            'industry commanding a market share of about 40 percent. Order '
            'bookings for the revamped Brezza compact SUV and Grand Vitara '
            'midsize SUV, both recent launches, have already crossed 70,000 '
            'and 20,000, respectively, as per last management conference call. '
            'We expect gross margin to improve going forward, driven by fall '
            'in the price of commodities, yen being devalued in comparison to '
            'rupee/dollar. In addition, volume ramp-up will bring in operating '
            'leverage. The higher fuel price has led to very strong demand for '
            'CNG, supported by good expansion in the CNG network (currently '
            'covering ~250 cities with 3800 stations against 1400 stations '
            'covering 150 cities 3-4 years back). CNG volumes consist of 20 '
            'percent of total sales volumes, Axis Securities said. : Maruti, '
            'already strong in the entry-level segment, seems to be focusing '
            'on regaining lost market share with the new launches in the '
            'compact and midsize SUV segments. We expect a rise in demand from '
            'new launches along with upgradation of existing product '
            'portfolio, softening commodity inflation and improving ECU '
            'shortages to support recovery in the margins. The company would '
            'gain further market share, driven by an expected shift towards '
            'petrol, CNG and hybrid vehicles. Looking at the existing order '
            'book we expect the companys volumes to witness strong growth '
            'H2FY23 onwards, said Axis Securities. Bajaj Finance began FY23 '
            'strong, with its assets under management (AUM) growing 28 percent '
            'on an annualised basis and 3 percent sequentially in the first '
            'quarter. This growth came from its strong presence in the rural '
            'market, loans to small, medium and large enterprises and '
            'mortgages. The approaching festive season is likely to help the '
            'company sustain its strong growth momentum. Additionally, the '
            'customer addition momentum remained strong with the highest-ever '
            'customer addition during the quarter, leading to customer base '
            'growth of 20/5 percent YoY/QoQ. The company plans to scale up its '
            'gold financing business by expanding its geographic reach. '
            'Moreover, the launch of non-captive two-wheeler financing in July '
            '2022 along with plans to foray into new auto loans in FY24 would '
            'support the companys AUM growth moving forward, the commentary '
            'read. It also plans to strengthen its credit card segment with '
            'its partnerships with RBL Bank and DBS. Thus, multiple new '
            'product launches coupled with sustained growth momentum in the '
            'existing products and strong momentum on new customer '
            'acquisitions should collectively drive growth for BAF going '
            'ahead. : Its digital initiatives and business transformation are '
            'key positives and appear to be going well. With the digital '
            'transformation journey likely to be completed by FY23, we believe '
            'it should contribute meaningfully to the overall growth. We '
            'believe the marginal compression in NIMs will be offset by '
            'improved fee income and stable credit costs, thereby enabling BAF '
            'to deliver superior return ratios, said Axis Securities. The '
            'festive season is traditionally a good one for card companies '
            'given the higher spending associated with it. In the first '
            'quarter, SBI Cards reported strong customer addition that drove '
            'cards in-force (CIF) growth of 19 percent year-on-year. Going '
            'ahead, SBI Cards intends to maintain the monthly acquisition '
            'run-rate of over 3 lakh new customers, targeting a mix of 50:50 '
            'between Banca and Open-market channels. A pick-up in '
            'travel-related spends along with improving discretionary spends, '
            'propelled spends growth in Q1FY23 and is likely to sustain with '
            'the expectations of a strong festive season. Spends/customers are '
            'likely to improve hereon, with the old category of spends '
            'reviving to pre-Covid levels and new categories of spends '
            'contributing incrementally to spends growth, the Axis Securities '
            'statement said. : Robust business momentum, improving NIMs, and '
            'muted credit costs will help SBIC deliver superior RoA/RoE of '
            '6-6.3 percent/27-28 percent over the medium term. However, owing '
            'to intensive competition, especially from the private banks, '
            'maintaining and improving market share will be challenging and '
            'remain a key monitorable. The RBIs proposal on linking of RuPay '
            'Credit cards with the UPI is structurally positive for the credit '
            'card industry as it will help in increasing the acceptance of '
            'Credit cards amongst UPI merchants. This, in turn, would enable '
            'credit card issuers to tap into the wallet share of UPI customers '
            'or allow the migration of UPI customers to credit cards along '
            'with improving the market penetration of credit cards. With over '
            '1 million RuPay cards, SBI Cards should be a key beneficiary of '
            'the proposal. The RBI in its recently released discussion paper '
            'has touched upon a possible cap/regulation of MDR on credit '
            'cards, which if implemented, could impact fee '
            'income/profitability. However, we await further clarity in the '
            'final guidelines from the regulator in this regard. The nascent '
            'economic recovery was reflected in Trents operating performance '
            'in the first quarter, with revenue growing 39 percent '
            'sequentially, outperforming its peers, and its fashion arm '
            'posting the best ever quarterly sales.  Superior store metrics, '
            'supply chain optimization, diligent focus on cost '
            'rationalization, aggressive store expansion, higher contribution '
            'from private brands, and innovative offerings in value space '
            'would be key growth drivers in the long run. The largest footwear '
            'manufacturer in India, the company boasts of several popular '
            'brands including Relaxo, Sparx, Flite and Bahamas, all leaders in '
            'their segments. Axis said, We believe value players such as '
            'Relaxo should see earnings and profitability improvement as rural '
            'and small towns recover coupled with market share gain from '
            'smaller/unorganized players, continued demand for quality '
            'value-for-money products in rural and smaller towns, strong '
            'festive season, and sustained product additions. Moreover, macro '
            'drivers such as lower per capita consumption in India and lower '

            'localisation, improving manufacturing quality and keep investing '
            'in emerging technologies for a sustainable growth,  Executive '
            'Chairman Kenichi Ayukawa said on Wednesday. Speaking at the 62nd '
            'session annual session of ACMA here, Ayukawa, who is also the '
            'president of auto industry body SIAM, noted that localisation is '
            'necessary to ensure growth of the auto component industry. "We '
            'have to go much deeper and find ways to localise smallest of the '
            'components, including raw material, wherever possible," he said. '
            'The industry should also focus on improving and sustaining higher '
            'levels of quality, he said. "Indian auto industry has gained a '
            'large scale, both in the domestic market and exports. At this big '
            'scale, quality holds a very high significance. Any small mistake '
            'exports. Any small mistake can be harmful not only for the '
            'industry but for the brand \'Make in India\'," he noted. '
            'Investing in new futuristic technologies is another area which '
            'the auto component industry should consider, Ayukawa said. "Prime '
            'Minister has committed a target of net zero carbon emission by '
            '2070 and 45 per cent reduction by 2030. In our journey of '
            'de-carbonisation to achieve 2070 and 45 per cent reduction by '
            '2030 these targets, industry should put efforts and invest in all '
            'feasible futuristic technologies," he said, Ayukawa also asked '
            'the industry to keep investing in the core businesses. "I always '
            'tell my supplier partners at Maruti Suzuki, that re-investing in '
            'the core business is very important. It not only strengthens your '
            'financials but also improves your ability to deal with '
            'challenges," he stated. Ayukawa said SIAM and ACMA should '
            'collaborate and put significant efforts to bring back and sustain '
            'the growth of the industry. ACMA President Sunjay Kapur, at the '
            'event, said that while passenger and commercial vehicle sales '
            'have returned to the pre-pandemic levels, two-wheeler sales are '

            'percent of them at the beginning of the quarter, as per Bloomberg '
            'data. Bajaj Finserv had a buy rating from seven out of the 10 '
            'analysts that have coverage on the stock. The reduction in '
            'optimism is likely a function of the sharp rally seen on the '

            'the sharp uptick in loan growth being witnessed at its subsidiary '

            'have remained constant at two, the number of hold ratings jumped '
            'to nine from six earlier, Bloomberg data showed. Other prominent '
            'winners of the September quarter that saw mild downgrades to '
            'their ratings from analysts included  ,  ,   and  . , which saw '
            'an 8 percent cut in its stock price and was the second worst '
            'performer on the Nifty 50 in the September quarter, saw analysts '
            'become more optimistic on its prospects. The imposition of '
            'additional excise duty on petroleum and diesel exports of the '
            'company led to a weak quarterly performance from the counter on '
            'concerns over the earnings of the energy segment. That, however, '
            'was no deterrent for some analysts as they upgraded the stock to '

            'crore in the corresponding quarter of previous fiscal. The fall '
            'in provisions stems from the improvement in asset quality '

            'and sequentially. Kotak Mahindra Bank has been a conservative '

            'in the previous quarter. An expansion of net interest margin to '
            '4.92 percent also helped support core interest income. NIM was '

{'article': 'The   introduced a provision mandating deduction of tax at source '
            'by a person providing any benefit or perquisite to a resident. '
            'The benefit or perquisite provided should arise from a business '
            'or profession conducted by such a resident. This provision, '
            'introduced through new section 194R of the Income Tax Act, will '
            'be effective July 1, 2022. The reason this rule is being so '
            'talked about these days is because it will impact social media '
            'influencers in a big way. In this age of internet and social '
            'media, influencer marketing has gained prominence.   play a '
            'crucial role in marketing products and services. They subtly or '
            'openly influence purchasing decisions of their followers and '
            'fans. Social media influencers could be celebrities, persons with '
            'expertise or authority in a particular field, or those having a '
            'social relationship with their audience. Open any social media '
            'platform or app, be it Facebook, Instagram or YouTube, and you '
            'will find influencers present everywhere through their blogs, '
            'posts, videos or reviews. These influencers typically get to '
            'retain the products they endorse or review. At times, these '
            'products could be of substantial value like an  , a piece of '
            'jewellery, clothing or even a car. Social media influencers may '
            'also get other benefits from their endorsements. For example, a '
            'travel or hotel company may provide free flight tickets or '
            'holiday packages to the influencers, restaurants may provide free '
            'meals, or the influencer may receive tickets to a fashion show or '
            'a film awards function. This kind of remuneration in the form of '
            'barter is everywhere, and the list is endless. Though such '
            'benefits are taxable in the hands of the influencer receiving '
            'them, they could rarely be tracked and so went tax-free. But the '
            'party is ending. The new section 194R hopes to cover all such '
            'transactions. This section provides for   if such benefit or '
            'perquisite arises from business or profession and the total value '
            'of such benefit or perquisite exceeds Rs 20,000 in a year. The '
            'Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT), the apex body implementing '
            'the income tax Act, recently issued guidelines in the form of a '
            'circular "clarifying" the new provision. Often, the benefit '
            'provided to the social media influencer is in kind. In such a '
            'case, how will the benefit provider deduct the tax? The circular '
            'issued by the CBDT clarifies that in such a case, the provider of '
            'the benefit must ensure that the tax that was required to be '
            'deducted has been paid by the recipient influencer. So, the '
            'influencer will have to pay 10 percent of the value of the '
            'benefit by way of advance tax and present the provider with '
            'evidence of payment in the form of a challan and a declaration '
            'before receiving the benefit. However, if the influencer returns '
            'the productsay, a smartphoneto the company, there will not be any '
            'benefit and the provision of section 194R will not apply. How '
            'will the benefit or the perquisite be valued for this section? '
            'The circular issued by the CBDT states that where the provider '
            'has purchased the product or service given to the social media '
            'influencer as a benefit, the purchase price will be considered '
            'for the valuation. If the provider itself manufactures the item '
            'provided as a benefit or perquisite, then the provider of the '
            'benefit has to consider the price that it charges customers for '
            'such a product as the value of the benefit. For example, if a '
            'company manufacturing, say, beauty products provides a make-up '
            'kit to the influencer, then the price at which the make-up kit is '
            'generally sold to the customers of the company will be considered '
            'for valuation and TDS will be on such value. In other cases, the '

            'considered for TDS. However, the circular does not give any '
            'further guidance to determine the fair market value. With this '

            'consider it as part of their income while filing their own tax '

            'the new provision is not restricted to social media influencers '
            'but has a wider application. It will cover all benefits provided '
            'under various situations. For example, many companies provide '
            'incentives in the form of holiday packages to dealers who achieve '
            'sales targets or to top-performing distributors. Companies will '
            'have to comply with TDS provisions under the new section and the '
            'dealers and distributors have to include the value of these '
            'benefits in their tax returns. Even in the case of business '
            'conferences of dealers or other business associates, to the '
            'extent there are expenses attributable to the leisure component '
            'or expenses attributable to family members, such expenses will be '
            'considered as benefits or perquisites and attract the provisions '
            'of section 194R. The provision will also apply to the '
            'distribution of free samples; for example, free samples of '
            'medicines received by doctors from pharmaceutical companies.',

{'article': 'Indian stocks have outperformed overseas markets for a couple of '
            'months, largely because of a perception among investors that '
            'Asias third-largest economy is in a relatively better position '
            'compared to others. The belief, amid talk of a recession in the '
            'US and Europe, supports the theory that the Indian economy is '
            'decoupled or detached from world markets, and so the rally may '
            'continue. Kotak Institutional Equities believes this theory is '
            'far from the truth; investors tend to like what they see or only '
            'see what they like. We hope that the Indian economy and market '
            'can live up to the high expectations implied in expensive '
            'valuations of the market. Economic recovery has been somewhat '
            'subpar so far and twin deficits are well above comfort levels '
            'even without factoring in any potential energy price shock, a '
            'team of analysts at Kotak led by Sanjeev Prasad wrote in a note '
            'on September 6. Thanks to the recent rally, in the year so far, '
            'the NSE Nifty is flat. In comparison, the S&P 500 has fallen 19 '
            'percent Nikkei 6 percent, FTSE 4 percent, DAX 20 percent, Hang '
            'Seng 19 percent and CAC 16 percent. This gives the impression '
            'that the Indian market may have decoupled from global markets. '
            'Prasad argues that decoupling is not possible in reality. We note '
            'that markets may decouple in the short term (for whatever '
            'reasons) but economic linkages will inevitably result in some '
            'relationship between markets too. The Indian economy is too '
            'interlinked with the global economy for economic or market '
            'decoupling in reality, he wrote. Some of his views conform with '
            'those of his peers at Jefferies and BoFA Securities who believe '
            'the market is overvalued. They have also turned cautious. Prasad '
            'believes a global slowdown will have severe repercussions for '
            'Indias balance of payments, which is already challenged by lower '
            'exports and lower capital inflows. At the same time, imports may '
            'stay high, especially if energy prices were to stay high. World '
            'markets have tumbled amid surging energy prices, especially in '
            'Europe. The crisis has been triggered by the war in Europe and '
            'following actions of Russia and western powers. The markets have '
            'also reflected the fallout of such a crisis. We are not sure if '
            'the Indian market is factoring in risks from short-term factors '
            'such as higher-for-longer inflation unlike other markets. Indian '
            'market valuations are quite expensive, Prasad wrote. Earnings '
            'yield is low relative to bond yield when compared with periods '
            'with similar levels of bond yields. Lastly, increasing '
            'medium-term risks linked to climate change and geopolitics '
            'warrant higher cost for equities. Kotak Institutional Equities '
            'has also made some portfolio changes. It added Sun Pharma to a '
            'recommended large-cap portfolio with a weight of 150 basis points '
            '(bp)s, saying it offered a potential 17 percent upside. Kotak is '
            'adopting a more defensive stance on its portfolio and reducing '
            'risks wherever possible. In this context, it has removed '
            'Motherson Sumi Systems (130 bps) from the portfolio given its '
            'high exposure to Europe. It also adjusted 20 bps from ICICI '
            'Prudential Life (to 250 bps). Kotak removed Ashok Leyland and '
            'Oberoi Realty from its recommended mid-cap portfolio, as both '
            'stocks have moved above the 12-month fair values after their '
            'strong performance over the past few weeks. Ashok Leyland is up '
            '14 percent and Oberoi Realty is up 14 percent over the past three '

            'strong uptrend on monthly charts with higher highs and higher '

            'at Rs 95 levels with Double Bottom formation on the weekly charts '
            'and moved up near its 52-week high indicating existence of a '
            'strong uptrend in the medium to long term. For the last couple of '

            'weekly & monthly charts is sustaining above the 55 mark which '
            'shows positive momentum of the stock. In the coming future, we '

            'one can get good buying opportunity in the stock for an upside '
            'potential of Rs 129 followed by Rs 143 levels. We recommend '
            'stop-loss for the trade at Rs 95 on a closing basis. The stock '
            'has overall been in a positive trend moving above the significant '
            '200-day moving average (DMA) zone of Rs 6,780 levels with a '
            'consolidation phase witnessed recently moving between the range '
            'of Rs 7,100 and Rs 7,600 levels but medium-term bias remains '
            'positive. We anticipate a revival from Rs 7,000 levels which is '
            'the support zone of the channel pattern on the daily chart with '
            'major support lying near the 200 DMA level of Rs 6,750. Our view '
            'gets negated only in case a breach below the 200DMA level is '
            'established and till then the overall trend remains positive. The '
            'stock has immense potential to rise further and one can buy and '
            'accumulate this stock for an upside target of Rs 8,000-8,200 '
            'keeping the stop-loss of Rs 6,700. The stock has indicated a '
            'breakout recently above Rs 545 levels and has strengthened the '
            'trend but with a correction has again slipped inside the channel '
            'with bias still remaining strong. The strong support visible is '

            'suggest buying and accumulating the stock at every decline till '

            'witnessed a very sharp correction of 13 percent in the last week. '
            'Since then the stock has been consolidating between Rs 710-730 '
            'and it has made a solid base near Rs 710 levels. On a daily '

            'an impulsive structure which is adding more confirmation for '
            'upside in coming days. One can buy between Rs 705-710 with upside '

            'the daily chart with potential reversal zone of Rs 390-395. In '
            'the current scenario, daily RSI (relative strength index) has a '
            'complex structure near the oversold zone which is also '
            'complemented by over-stretched daily MACD (moving average '
            'convergence and divergence) hintingatearly reversal in counter. '
            'One can buy between Rs 393-396 with upside seen till Rs 440 with '
            'credible support seen at Rs 375. The free fall that started from '
            'November 2021 till June 2022 resulted in a 43 percent decline in '
            'price. On a weekly scale the counter has formed a bullish shark '
            'with potential reversal zone of Rs 960-990 along with double '
            'bottom near mentioned PRZ (potential reversal zone) which is '
            'adding more confirmation for early reversal in the said counter. '
            'From an indicator perspective, weekly RSI (relative strength '
            'index) has formed a complex structure along with the MACD bullish '
            'cross which further confirms upside in the counter. One can buy '
            'in small tranches at current levels and buy another tranche at '
            'around Rs 1,010 levels (if again tested). Upside is expected till '
            'Rs 1,145 and support is seen around Rs 970. The stock has been '
            'consolidating around the crucial support of 200DMA after it '
            'corrected from Rs 235 to Rs 176 in quick sessions. The RSI has '
            'entered into an oversold zone which may induce a recovery over '
            'the short term. A decisive move above Rs 185 may induce a strong '
            'rally towards Rs 210. The stock corrected sharply on the daily '
            'timeframe from Rs 490 levels to Rs 390 levels. The sharp '
            'correction is now being followed up by consolidation in the daily '
            'timeframe. The RSI is entering into an oversold zone which may '
            'induce a recovery over the short term. A decisive move above Rs '

{'article': 'Even as the Indian market has closed its eyes to global weakness '
            'and moved ahead in recent weeks, some analysts are worried that '
            'recession in western nations could be a headwind for the Indian '
            'market going ahead. "Europe and China that are large components '
            'of the global economy are not likely to show any good news for '
            'the next few months, said Mihir Vora, Chief Investment Officer at '
            'Max Life Insurance, in an interaction with CNBC TV-18. The US Fed '
            'and ECB are very hawkish. These are huge headwinds for global '
            'markets. Thats what makes me a bit worried for India also. The '
            'European Central Bank (ECB) on September 8 raised its policy '
            'rates by an unprecedented 75 basis points to deal with inflation '
            'in the continent. Another similar hike may also be in the offing '
            'during the next policy meeting, the central bank hinted. '
            'Meanwhile, the US Fed has also said it will keep raising interest '
            'rates. Numura in a note said the  this month and a half-point at '
            'the November meeting. Vora said the Indian economy is strong, and '
            'the domestic story in short and long term is quite robust. In '
            'fact, the growth outlook is even better than what it was ahead of '
            'the pandemic, he added. In such a scenario, sectors that are '
            'focused on the local market are likely to do well. He commented '
            'on flour sectors that need to be looked at carefully: As crude '
            'oil prices tumbled in the international market, the cement sector '
            'has again got its mojo back. Shares of cement companies zoomed as '
            'much as 15 percent during the week, attracting investors. The '
            'sector surprises on the upside when people start talking about '
            'it. It is one of the pure local segment with supply discipline. '
            'So, whenever there is a bit of positivity about the local '
            'economy, it tends to do well, said Vora. It is also supported by '
            'data points by real estate and government standing on infra. '
            'Banking stocks have been the flavour of the season. Many stocks '
            'from the sector are trading at their fresh highs, including   '
            'and  . However, Vora believes there is still lot of steam left in '
            'the sector. They are still now outperforming vis-a-vis their '
            'pre-pandemic levels. Banks underperformed quite a lot from '
            '2020-21, and it is only catching up. If you compare the '
            'valuation, they have not crossed their previous high. Hence there '
            'is some valuation support as well, he said. Voraprefers private '
            'banks over PSU ones,even ashe is bullish on a couple of big names '
            'from the latter group. The IT sector has been among a few '
            'segments where supply has outpaced the demand. This has likely '
            'happened because of the global nature of the business. So when, '
            'US and Europe dont do well, IT sector tends to suffer. Vora '
            'underlined that western economy has seen the best of government '
            'spending and now there is a good chance that corporate demand for '
            'IT services will not be as good as it was during the pandemic. '
            'Auto sector has also been a standout story in the last few months '
            'as demand has come back along with softness in raw material '
            'prices. Vora believes the sector is yet to see the peak. Car and '
            'two-wheeler demand has barely come back to pre-pandemic levels. '
            'So there should be some steam left as far as demand is concerned. '
            'Other tailwinds like crude oil and war material prices are behind '

            'percent of loans in 1Q23 as against 31 percent in FY20), we see a '

            'major international markets. Technology has seen the highest '
            'growth as a category and is one-third of our total valuation. '
            'Globally, tech is the driver of growth in overall valuation and '
            'there are three countries in the world where technology comprises '
            'a significant part of the total valuation. One is the US, then '
            'China and India. India is now higher than China in percentage '
            'contribution of technology to the total valuation, said Mohanty. '
            'She added that TCS is the new number one and has displaced HDFC '
            'Bank, which currently ranks second with a brand value of $32.7 '
            'billion. HDFC Bank had held the top position since the first '
            'ranking was unveiled in 2014. TCS is also one of the brands that '
            'has entered the global top 100 most valuable brands ranking and '
            'along with Infosys has seen maximum growth in brand value, '
            'Mohanty added. The top 10 most valuable Indian brands contribute '
            'over half of the rankings total value and there has been '
            'significant movement at the top in addition to the two most '
            'valuable brands switching positions, the Kantar report said.  '
            'with a brand value of $13.6 billion has risen four places to rank '
            'sixth. We have 14 new entrants across 11 categories and there are '
            'about 11 startups and the number of startups has increased '
            'year-on-year. More startups are entering because they are '
            'disrupting the market and have headroom to grow. Also, some of '
            'the large ad spenders are startups unlike traditional brands '
            'which tend to go dark whenever there is an issue. So they '
            '(startups) are investing behind brand building. This is what is '
            'helping the startups to grow, said Mohanty. Brand value of the '
            'startups category has increased from $23 billion in 2020 to $44 '
            'billion in 2022. Edtech and foodtech are the big segments in the '

{'article': 'It doesnt look like the rally in bank stocks will end anytime '
            'soon. At least thats what can be inferred from how analysts are '
            'rerating select bank stocks, raising their target prices and '
            'earnings estimates. Morgan Stanley has gone a step ahead and '
            'rerated the entire banking sector, initiating what it called the '
            'second leg of the rerating cycle. Bank stock rerating cycles work '
            'in two legs and Indian banks appear to be in a transition phase '
            'between the two, the brokerage house said in a September 6 note. '
            'The first leg is usually driven by expectations around better '
            'asset quality. As tail risks recede, stocks improve sharply to '
            'normalised multiples  this has already occurred over the past two '
            'years, it said. The second, more sustained leg is usually driven '
            'by loan growth acceleration that sets an earnings upgrade cycle, '
            'and we believe catalysts for this are falling into place. The '
            'impact of the first leg is already visible in the stock prices. '
            'The Nifty Bank index, a representative measure of the banking '
            'sector, is up over 11 percent so far this year compared to the '
            'much broader Nifty, which has risen 1.56 percent. For the past '
            'few quarters, banks have enjoyed healthy credit growth, strong '
            'balance sheets and improving asset quality. Analysts at Morgan '
            'Stanley said they now expect loan growth to accelerate and be '
            'sustained as capex spending speeds up. Our macro team sees a new '
            'leg of investment upcycle led by improving trends in capacity '
            'utilisation rates, in addition to corporate sector profitability '
            'and de-leveraged banking sector balance sheets. This in turn '
            'could foster job creation, accelerate income growth, and drive '
            'more growth opportunities even in the retail/SME segment, said '
            'Morgan Stanley. It raised loan growth estimates by 2 percentage '
            'points (ppts) to 16 percent for FY24 and 3 ppts to 17 percent for '
            'FY25. This, coupled with lower credit costs, drives its earnings '
            'estimate upgrades (2 ppts in pre-provisioning operating profit '
            'growth) and higher RoE assumptions, the broker added. What has '
            'surprised some money managers is that credit growth has jumped in '
            'India when global issues have resurfaced and an economic slowdown '
            'looks imminent. That means Indian lenders are bucking the global '
            "trend. In all past instances, we have seen Indian banks' credit "
            'growth slipping as the global and Indian economy slowed. In this '
            'cycle, however, we are yet to see banking credit growth slow. In '
            'fact, this is for the first time that credit growth is improving '
            'even when global growth falters, DSP Mutual Fund said in a recent '
            'note. Credit growth in India may not slow down significantly and '
            'lending may remain a strong investment case, it added, '
            'reiterating what Morgan Stanley said in its report. Morgan '
            'Stanley increased price targets for all bank stocks under its '

            'or higher inflation and deflation of commodity prices in next 2-3 '
            'years,   CEO and MD Sanjiv Mehta said on Tuesday. The '

            'several global factors, including supply chain disruption due to '
            'the pandemic and Ukraine-Russia war, he said while speaking at '

            'but I think where we have to be ready with is possible three '
            'scenarios in the world today," Mehta said when asked about his '
            'thoughts on the possibility of inflation coming down in the near '
            'future. One possibility is, he said, "the inflation or a slight '
            'deflation will continue at a moderated pace from the elevated '
            'base today. The second is it could go up even further and the '
            'third is there could be a deflation in commodity prices." "This '
            "is a horizon I'm looking at for the next two, three years and as "
            'businesses, we have to be ready for each of the three scenarios." '
            'Mehta said a big difference in the elevated levels of inflation '
            'this time is that earlier it used to be in one or two commodities '
            'but "this time, it has been across a range of commodities. That '
            'is the reason why it\'s become a massive global issue". The '
            'wholesale price-based inflation had eased to 11-month low of '
            '12.41 per cent in August, on softening in prices of manufactured '
            'and fuel products, even as food items remained expensive. '
            'Although the WPI-based inflation declined for three consecutive '
            'months, it remained in double digit for 17 months beginning April '
            'last year. The inflation was 13.93 per cent in July and 11.64 per '
            'cent in August last year. It had touched a record high of 15.88 '
            'per cent in May this year. Global supply chain disruptions caused '
            'by COVID-19, the huge amount of fiscal spending, especially in '
            'many developed world, and the war in Ukraine and its impact on '
            'energy prices are the main reasons for high inflation, he added. '

            'competitor, for another quarter. Infosys revenue growth of 24 '
            'percent was significantly more than 16 percent growth registered '
            'by TCS.   Though, in terms of margin, TCS again reported better '
            'numbers than Infosys at 23.1 percent, despite a contraction. '
            'Infosys operating margin contracted 3.6 percent to 20.1 percent, '
            'registering a relatively sharper fall. Infosys also revised FY23 '
            'revenue upwards, increasing to 14-16 percent. At the end of FY22, '
            'the company had set revenue growth guidance in constant currency '
            'in the range of 13-15 percent for FY23. The company retained '
            'margin guidance at 21-23 percent. Infosys said total contract '
            'value (TCV) of its large deals were at $1.7 billion during the '
            'quarter. This was significantly lower than $2.3 billion for '
            'Q4FY22, but in line with wider industry trend that has seen a '
            'decline in deal value during March quarter. Voluntary attrition '
            'in the last twelve months in the IT services was at 28.4 percent, '
            'the company said. In comparison, it was 27.7 percent in the '

            'Total employee count of the company also increased to 3,35,186 '

            'It expects margins in the manufacturing vertical to increase in '
            'the June 2022 quarter. The brokerages expect Infosys to retain a '

            'growth momentum. This scenario may put short-term pressures on '
            'the Indian IT Services Industry. However, long-term IT spending '
            'still remains resilient, analysts added. The recent management '
            'commentaries from top IT firms and market expectation is that '
            'September 2022 quarter is going to be a sequentially strong '
            'quarter from a revenue growth perspective in constant currency '
            'terms. However, companies do not seem very confident about 2HFY23 '
            'and have not given out an explicitly strong demand commentary. '
            'The market is hoping that there will be no material negative '
            'surprises on the revenue front in 2HFY23, although it will likely '
            'be seasonally weak. The recent hawkish Fed commentary and '
            'expectations of much tighter policy increased the risk of deep '
            'recession. "We are in the shallow US recession camp and believe '
            'that it will lead to low-to-mid single digit dollar revenue '
            'growth for the Tier-1 Indian IT players, with Tier-2 sets growing '
            'at a high single digit rate. In our current estimates, we are not '
            'building in any pricing cuts, although we are taking a generous '
            'view on supply-side pressures in that year with attrition likely '
            'not being a big issue," said Nirmal Bang in its recent note.',

            'higher energy and freight costs, O2C business has delivered its '
            'best performance ever. I am also happy with the progress of our '
            'Consumer platforms," said Chairman and Managing Director Mukesh '
            'Ambani in a press statement. RIL reported a 45.8 percent '
            'year-on-year rise in consolidated operating profit to a record '
            'high of Rs 40,179 crore for the quarter ended June. The strength '
            "in the company's June quarter performance came from therefining "
            'and petrochemicaldivision which posted its highest ever quarterly '
            'revenue aided by a tight global energy market. The segment '
            'reported 56.7 percent on-year growth in revenues to Rs 1.6 lakh '
            'crore aided by strong gross refining margins in the international '
            'market. "Despite significant challenges posed by the tight crude '
            'markets and higher energy and freight costs, O2C business has '
            'delivered its best performance eve," Ambani said. The operating '
            'performance of the segment was strong as operating profit jumped '
            '62.6 percent on-year to Rs 19,888 crore. The embargo by the '
            'European Union on Russian oil products, higher gas to oil '
            'switching, strong travel demand and lower product inventory '
            'levels resulted in tight fuel markets, RIL said. The vertical '
            'performed strongly in the June quarter with revenues rising 183 '
            'percent on-year to Rs 3,625 crore aided by higher administered '
            'gas prices for the domestic market. The company said that KGD6 '
            'gas production during the June quarter was at 40.6 billion cubic '
            'feet as against33.1 billion cubic feet in the year-ago quarter. '
            'Average gas price realized by RIL for KGD6 gas was at $ 9.72per '
            'mmBtuas against$3.62per mmBtuin the year-ago quarter. The '
            "segment's operating profitsoared 243.4 percent on-year to Rs "
            '2,737 crore largely because of higher volumes and realisations in '
            'the quarter. The oil and gas business witnessed higher revenue '
            'and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization '
            'driven by higher gas price and production. RIL said that in its '
            'KG D6-MJ Gas and Condensate fields the final offshore subsea '
            'production installation campaign is underway and is likely to be '
            'completed by the second quarter of FY23. The company is also '
            'planning to start drilling for exploration at the KG UDW1 well '
            'next year. The whole idea is, any resources that we can create, '
            'we can monetize the existing infrastructure. So the prospect '
            'maturation is underway and we expect to undertake an exploration '
            '(for KG UDW1) next year. Once the energy field is commissioned, '
            'we should be progressively moving towards delivering more than 1 '
            'bcf per day by FY24, said Sanjay Roy, senior vice-president for '
            'exploration and production. RIL pegs oil demand to average 99.2 '
            'million barrel per day globally, up1.7 million barrel per day '
            'year-on-year. There is limited spare refining capacity and the '
            'strong oil demand will keep refining margins higher. There is '
            'clear recovery in aviation demand because the pandemic is '
            'subsiding. There are lower exports from China which are '
            'supporting margins, V Shrikanth, joint chief financial officer '
            'said. He added that certain petrochemical products may see range '
            'bound margins due to capacity overhang. He said that transport '
            'fuel demand globally is likely to remain strong. Polymer and '
            'polyester demand is likely to pick up with the upcoming festival '
            'season. On the challenges side, we have been seeing the whole '
            'concern of recession, slowdown on the back of both higher prices '
            'as well as the responses by various central banks all over the '
            'world wanting to take interest rates up to curb inflationAny duty '
            'on exports you know will have an impact on overall realization '
            'that we have, Shrikanth said. The consumer technology business, '
            'which houses the telecom operations, reported a 23.8 percent '
            'on-year growth in revenue from operations to Rs 23,467 crore. Net '
            'subscriber addition witnessed a strong rebound to 9.7 million in '
            'the June quarter driven by continued strength in gross additions '
            'at35.2 million and reduced SIM consolidation impact, the company '
            'said. Average revenue per user saw 4.8 percent sequential rise to '
            'Rs 175.7 as the company benefited from the tariff hikes '
            "undertaken last year. The segment's operating profit jumped 28.5 "
            'percent on-year to Rs 11,424 crore on healthy subscriber addition '
            'and realisations. The first COVID-19 restriction free quarter '
            "helped RIL's organised retail business to thrive as footfalls "
            'improved even though ongoing inflationary environment capped '
            'performance. The segment reported a 53.7 percent on-year rise in '
            'revenue from operations to Rs 51,582 crore in the reported '

            'COVID situation improved though sentiments remained cautious due '
            'to inflationary concerns," RIL said. RIL said that footfalls were '

            'sector in our assessment, said Vikas Gupta, CEO and investment '
            'strategist, OmniScience Capital. The sector is riding on a '
            'robust, multi-decadal, secular growth vectordigital '
            'transformation. This is a multi-trillion-dollar opportunity and '
            'Indian IT stocks providing services to US companies undergoing '
            'digital transformation have growth visibility for a long period '
            'of time and can easily ride through any recessionary period, '
            'Gupta added. From the technical point of view, the IT sector '
            'topped out in January 2022 and has been correcting for the past '
            'nine months. The correction in the IT index has halted around '
            '26,200 levels which is very close to the 40-month exponential '
            'moving average (EMA) of 25,550, said Jatin Gedia, technical '
            'research analyst, capital market strategy, Sharekhan by BNP '
            'Paribas. Considering the prolonged period of correction and '
            'prices reaching crucial long-term support levels, a pullback '
            'appears highly probable. On the upside, Gedia expects the IT '
            'index to target levels of 30,500 which also coincides with '
            '200-day EMA and the previous swing high. He sees bullish '
            'implications in  and However, Nishit Master, portfolio manager, '
            'Axis Securities PMS, holds a contrarian view about the sector and '
            'it will continue to underperform. IT valuations, even after the '
            'recent correction, are higher than their long-term averages and, '
            'with the economies of the US and Europe slowing down, we expect '
            'the demand environment for IT services to weaken going forward, '
            'Master added. Experts suggest that after the outperformance '
            'witnessed in the pharma sector during the pandemic, the sector '
            'has been underperforming and has delivered negative returns of 11 '
            'percent over the last 12 months. After underperforming in the '
            'previous year, the pharmaceutical sector appears to be on track '
            'to perform well over the next five years, said Raghvendra Nath, '
            'managing director, Ladderup Wealth Management. Technically, the '
            'sector is hovering near its support levels and has witnessed some '
            'buying at 12,00011,900 levels. We expect the NSE pharma index to '
            'hold on to this support area and expect a pullback till the '
            '13,10013,200 zone where the previous swing high and weekly upper '
            'Bollinger band is placed, said Gedia. The hospitals sector is '
            'also likely to be in focus as a continued rise in '
            'lifestyle-related diseases and higher awareness of chronic '
            'illness will be the key growth drivers. This is one sector which '
            'has gained momentum in COVID times and with expanded '
            'infrastructure and higher budget allocation, the sector looks '
            'good, said Raj Vyas, investment analyst at Teji Mandi. From the '
            'pharma pack, and are bucking the downtrend and are outperforming '
            'among peers. Both these stocks are trading above their respective '
            '200-day moving averages (DMAs) and while the index was falling, '
            'these stocks entered a consolidation and thus prevented price '
            'correction, said Gedia. So, in case of an upside in the pharma '
            'sector, these stocks are likely to lead on the upside. The '
            'banking sector appears to be in a sweet spot, as according to the '
            'latest Reserve Bank of India data, credit growth is back and '
            'after 8-9 years, double-digit growth is seen for the sector. '
            'Overall, credit growth was around 15.5 percent, the best since '
            'November 2013. The deposit momentum too has started to pick up '
            'and this augurs well for large banks that have been capturing '
            'market share from the mid-sized and small banks, said Vyas. Banks '
            'are likely to expand from here on out owing to the economic '
            'recovery, increased capex and retail credit push. Also, with the '
            'rise in interest rates, margins and earnings for the sector are '
            'set to rise. Experts favour   and   from the sector on the back '
            'of pick-up in credit growth and stable net interest margins. '
            'Experts believe that the power and utilities sector has also '
            'witnessed lot of selling and are in the oversold category. These '
            'are defensive sectors which tend to weather crises with ease '
            'compared to growth sectors. The focus should be on strong, '
            'high-dividend-paying companies in these sectors, said Gupta. '
            'Several power generation companies have numerous projects which '
            'are in the pipeline and on the verge of being commissioned. Once '
            'these come online, revenues and profitability of these companies '
            'will increase significantly. Apart from the above-mentioned ones, '
            'experts are also positive on sectors that are strong domestic '
            'plays like defence, auto and FMCG. Defence is likely to ride on '
            'the Make in India push by the Indian government while auto is '
            'witnessing the easing of the semiconductor crisis, fall in '
            'commodity prices and continued strong domestic demand. Experts '
            'favour , and from this pack. A revival in rural demand after a '
            'largely normal monsoon as well as the festival season is likely '
            'to play out well for FMCG stocks.',

{'article': ' will hold its annual general meeting on Monday, an event thats '
            'known to always move the highest-weighted stock of the Nifty 50 '
            'index. Investors and analysts have come to expect major '
            'announcements from the conglomerate. Last year, it was the entry '
            'into green energy, and the year before, it was the induction of '
            'Google as a minority investor. In 2016, it was the launch of '
            'telecom services. The AGM will be held via video conferencing for '
            'the third consecutive year on August 29. The meeting will start '
            'at 2:00 pm IST, with addresses and presentations expected from '
            'chairman Mukesh Ambani and other members of the companys board '
            'and subsidiaries. The board of directors and shareholders will '
            'then vote on 11 resolutions. Six of them are special resolutions, '
            'including the appointment of Hital Meswani as a whole-time '
            'director, and the insertion of clauses in its articles of '
            'association with respect to its new energy business. Reliance '
            'shares tend to move considerably ahead of and after the AGM. The '
            'shares have averaged negligible returns a week prior to the AGM, '
            'based on data of the past 10 years. However, they rose almost 4 '
            'percent a week after the event, Bloomberg data showed. '
            'Additionally, the shares gained 2.3 percent a month before the '
            'AGM and returned more than 6 percent a month after the event, the '
            'data showed. Trading in the stock tends to pick up around the '
            'annual event. On average, daily volumes on the counter have '
            'spiked 317 percent on the day of the AGM over the past five '
            'years. AGM day is easily the most active for the stock. As with '
            'every Reliance AGM, investors have a set of expectations. This '
            'year, the focus will be on the consumer retail business once '
            'again, after chatter that a time line is likely to be announced '
            'for the listing of Jio Platforms and Reliance Retail. The '
            'induction of private equity investors in both its consumer-facing '
            'subsidiaries in 2020 was seen as a stepping stone towards their '
            'eventual listing. Brokerage JP Morgan India said in a recent note '
            'that Reliance has enhanced disclosures around related-party '
            'transactions, which is seen as a step towards greater '
            'transparency ahead of the listing. While it is too early to say '
            'if the increased disclosures on the large transactions between '
            'the subsidiaries are a step on the road to the listing of these '
            'businesses, it would be seen as a positive, JP Morgan said. '
            'Another key expectation will be around the new energy business, '
            'which emerged as the biggest takeaway at last years AGM. Reliance '
            'has since invested in acquiring companies in the segment and '
            'expanding capacity. The company plans to build four gigafactories '
            'to manufacture solar panels, electric batteries, green hydrogen '
            'and hydrogen fuel cells with an investment of $80 billion. The '
            'company sees renewable energy and green hydrogen as tectonic '
            'shifts in meeting the worlds energy demands. In the companys '
            'annual report, Ambani said he expects the green energy business '
            'to be the crown jewel of the company in the next seven years, '
            'much like he heralded the consumer-facing businesses about seven '
            'years ago. Brokerage JM Financial said investors will await any '
            'indication of the induction of strategic investors in the '
            'companys oil-to-chemicals and green energy business as Relance '
            'steps up activity in the space. Attention will also be on '
            'Reliances plan to roll out 5G mobile phone services after the '
            'company mopped up the most spectrum in the recent auction. '
            'Reliance invested $11.3 billion to acquire 25 gigahertz of '
            'spectrum from the government. Investors will wait for indications '
            'of the pricing of the new 5G services that step-down subsidiary '
            'Reliance Jio will offer. Traders can expect good moves in the '
            'stock if the company were to make announcements with respect to '
            'these expectations, said dealers. Reliances June quarter '
            'performance was slightly underwhelming, given the expectations '
            'built up due to the surge in global refining margins. The '
            'introduction of a special additional excise duty on refining '
            'exports also dampened spirits, but analysts remain buoyed over '
            'the stocks prospects. Of 39 brokerages covering the company, 31 '
            'have an outright buy rating on the stock while three have a hold '
            'rating with an average upside of about 12 percent expected in the '
            'scrip over the next 12 months. UBS Securities upgraded the stock '
            'recently to a buy from neutral as it factored in opportunities in '
            'the green energy business, which it said could create additional '
            'value of $35 billion for the company by 2030.',

            'their wardrobes, Jain said. Fashion marketplace Ajio, it said, '
            'continued to attract customers even as footfalls to stores '
            'returned to normative levels. This is reflected in the shopping '
            'value which is twice for >1-year customers compared to new '
            'customers who are on the platform for under 90 days. The luxury '
            'business grew by five times over last year driven by fully '
            'operational mall stores and in-store events. The business through '
            'AJIO Luxe scaled up over six times as compared to last year with '
            'presence of nearly 400 brands and over 38,000 options on the '
            'platform. Reliance Jewels, too, the company said, delivered a '
            'strong quarter with revenues up nearly three times over last year '
            'driven by strong festive sales, wedding season and network '
            'expansion. The lingerie business grew nearly five times YoY as '
            'the businesses scaled up their online offering and offline '
            'distribution. With Amante, Clovia and Zivame as part of its '

            'revenues and doubled its business over last year. Being a '
            'pan-India player, Reliance Retail has utilized its network, scale '
            'and efficient sourcing to optimize product prices to reduce the '
            'burden of inflationary pressures on our customers. We have kept '
            'prices of key daily consumption items low to reduce the '
            'inflationary impact on consumers wallet, it said. The business '
            'has also been focusing on increasing the share of non-food '
            'categories to. Through these concerted efforts, share of non-food '

            'said the retail major. During the period, business launched two '
            'new brands - Bubbles in soft drink & Joyland in confectionary to '
            'an encouraging response. The e-commerce marketplace JioMart is '
            'now present in 268 cities and its merchant base in Q1 jumped by '
            'four times over last year as the business focused on onboarding '
            'HoReCa and institutions in addition to Kirana merchants. The '
            'business augmented supply chain infrastructure with the addition '
            'of 33 new fulfillment centers including four cold chain '
            'facilities for faster delivery to the merchant partners. The '
            'growth in JioMart Kirana orders is driven by increased merchant '
            'penetration and addition of region-specific assortment in '
            'commodities, it said. Pharma business, too, nearly doubled over '
            'last year on the back of stronger store performance as well as '
            'digital commerce platform, Reliance Retail said. To enhance '
            'customer shopping experience, 80 percent of the store network is '
            'now hyperlocal enabled which is helping in faster deliveries to '
            'customers. The business is quickly ramping up its presence with '
            'reach scaled to over 2,400 towns, while merchant base increased '
            'by 50 percent over same period last quarter. The company aims to '
            'capture larger India opportunity through continued store '
            'expansion while at the same time further strengthen its digital '
            'commerce and omni-commerce capabilities. Our digital commerce and '
            'omni-channel capabilities have been resulting into much stronger '
            'engagement with our customers as they shop at the stores as well '
            'as our platforms; so we will continue to strengthen that part, '
            'said Jain. Reliance Retail also plans to keep onboarding new '
            'merchants and increase the share of wallet to strengthen its new '
            'commerce business. We will look at strengthening the entire '
            'supply chain infrastructure as well as the product and design '
            'capabilities. And further scale up all the businesses that we '
            'have acquired and also partnered with over the period of time, '

            'revenue and Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and '
            'Amortization (EBITDA). Segment revenues for Q1 increased by 56.7 '
            'percent YoY to Rs 1.62lakhcrore, primarily on account of higher '
            'crude oil and product prices. Segment EBITDA for 1Q FY23 improved '
            'by 62.6 percent YoY to Rs 19,888 crore primarily on account of '
            'sharp rise in transportation fuel cracks and better volumes. RIL '
            'said it maintained high O2C utilisation levels across sites and '
            'units. Total throughput (including refinery) was 19.7 million '

            '3,625 crore. Segment EBITDA sharply increased to Rs 2,737 crore. '
            'This was primarily due to improved gas price realization in KG D6 '
            'and CBM, and higher production in KG D6. The company said average '
            'gas price realized for KGD6 was at $9.72/MMBTU in Q1FY23 versus '

            'translated into 220million transactions in Q1, a growth of more '
            'than 60 percent over pre-Covid levels, RIL said. The positive '
            'impact was also visible in the registered customer base, which '
            'crossed a milestone of 200 million. The customer base stood at '
            '208million at the end of the quarter, up 29 percent YoY. Reliance '

            'with an area of 45.5 million sq ft covers all corners of the '

            'climbed 27 percent. The company said its revenue, and in turn '
            'ARPU, increased driven by residual impact of tariff hike and '
            'acceleration in fiber to the home (FTTH) service. EBITDA margin '
            'of the telecom business also increased 176 bps YoY to 48.7 '
            'percent due to ARPU increase in connectivity business partly '
            'offset by inflationary pressure on operating costs. The company '
            'said total data traffic for Jio was 25.9 billion GB during the '
            'quarter, rising 27.2 percent YoY. Total voice traffic was 1.25 '
            'trillion minutes during the quarter, a rise of 17.2 percent YoY. '
            'This was on the total customer base of 41.99 crore as of '
            'June-end. Thus, average data and voice consumption per user per '
            'month increased to 20.8 GB and 1,001 minutes, respectively. The '
            'company said its media business saw a drop in some numbers due to '
            'various reasons. Consolidated revenue rose 10.4 percent YoY to Rs '
            '1,340 crore but high inflation created a challenging environment '
            'for advertising revenue while subscription revenue continued to '
            'be stymied by the delay in new tariff order (NTO 2.0) '
            'implementation. The company said operating costs jumped 26 '
            'percent thanks to increased investments in entertainment content '
            'and marketing. Consolidated EBITDA was Rs 46 crore, down 75.5 '
            'percent on a Y-o-Y basis. Operating margin was at 3.4 percent, '
            'down from 15.5 percent YoY. RIL said the company was forging '
            'alliances to realise its goal for the new energy business, which '
            'includes setting up four giga factories in Jamnagar to produce '
            'soal modules, batteries, hydrogen and conversion of hydrogen into '
            'energy. Reliance is committed to invest in Indias energy '
            'security. Our New Energy business is forging partnerships with '

            'vision of clean, green and affordable energy solutions for all '
            'Indians, the company said. On a consolidated basis, RIL said its '

            'billion). Cash and cash equivalents stood at Rs 2,05,727 crore '

{'article': 'Climate change is one of the biggest threats that the world '
            'faces, and that is also where the biggest business opportunities '
            'lie. Ltd chairman and managing director Mukesh Ambani reaffirmed '

            "conglomerate's 45th Annual General Meeting (AGM) on August 29. "

            'which makes Reliances new energy vision far more transformational '
            'and far more global. The company plans to invest Rs 75,000 crore '
            'in new energy. We have made rapid progress to create an advanced '
            'manufacturing ecosystem for new energy, which will be fully '
            'integrated, backed by world-class talent, built on pillars of '
            'technological innovation through strategic partnerships, to '

            'manufacturing business based in India, for India and the world, '
            'Ambani said. Market experts said that Reliances big plans will '
            'ensure that the company stays highly valued even as the '
            'traditional fossil fuel companies struggle to keep their '
            'companies from getting de-rated because of ESG concerns. Baring '
            'this year, as several companies saw stock price head higher '
            'because of a surge in oil prices and refining markets, the '
            'perception of fossil fuel companies remains poor as the world '
            'moves with greater resolve toward new energy to reduce carbon '
            'footprint. We are aiming for continuous hyper-growth over many '
            'decades from new energy and to establish India as a world leader '
            'in new energy advanced manufacturing, the RIL chairman said. The '
            'company aims to establish 10GW (giga watt) of annual cell and '
            'module capacity by 2024 and scale it up to 20GW fully integrated '
            'quartz to module annual capacity by 2026. Its strategic '
            'acquisitions of Lithium Werks, Faradion and a stake in Ambri have '
            'provided the company with differentiated and superior battery '
            'chemistries. The company intends to set up battery-pack facility '
            'by 2023, scale it to 5GWh annual cell to pack manufacturing by '
            '2024 and further scale it up to 50GWh by 2027. Reliance is one of '
            'the largest producers of grey hydrogen (gH2) in the world and '
            'intends to complete its transition to gH2 by 2025. It has set the '
            'ball rolling to establish Giga scale gH2 manufacturing in India. '
            'The company will also establish 20 GW solar generation capacity '
            'by 2025for round-the-clock and intermittent power for gH2. Green '
            'hydrogenis generated from electrolysis of water, with the entire '
            'process run on renewable energy. The traditional oil '
            'manufacturing companies the world over face the risk of getting '
            'de-rated in the event of a fall in crude prices, as future growth '
            'is likely to shift to new energy. Even though these companies '
            'will continue to generate cash, as oil will continue to find '
            'usage the world over for years to come, these companies are '
            'likely to see a continued de-rating on future growth concerns. '
            'Until last year, most global oil companies, including giants like '
            'Chevron and Exxon Mobile, were trading at low earnings multiples '
            'and high dividend yields because of poor investor perception. But '
            'the story may be vastly different for Reliance, despite its '
            'dominance in the oil business. Its mega plans of becoming a '
            'global leader in new energy businesses, experts feel will not '
            'only help the company achieve its target of becoming '
            'carbon-neutral but also aid in avoiding a possible de-rating of '
            'the stock. Reliance has credibly proved its capability to '
            'diversify into other businesses from its traditional oil & gas '
            'business. Reliance Jio and Reliance Retail provide ample proof of '
            'it. But the new energy business plans ensure a multi-year growth '
            'engine even as the investor perception improves rather than '
            'deteriorates. With the new energy mega plan, Reliance is again '
            'going to do it directly into the new energy ecosystems which are '
            'going to replace conventional oil ecosystems, said Vikas Gupta, '
            'CEO and Chief Investment Strategist, OmniScience Capital. The '
            'full span from solar energy production to hydrogen technology and '
            'battery grid for energy storage makes it likely that Reliance '
            'might get entrenched in the new energy ecosystem. Gupta is of the '
            'opinion that the companys return ratios could dip in the medium '
            'term while the ramp up of new tech is going on but it is unlikely '
            'that the stock will face any de-rating. However, the market will '
            'give credit for the capital work in progress and a premium for '
            'the new clean-tech keeping in mind that whenever Reliance has '
            'entered a new arena it has become a keystone species in that new '
            'ecosystem, Gupta said. The future value of course, will be based '
            'on it capturing a large percentage of the expected total '
            'addressable market (TAM). The switch to green energy and '
            "sustainability will also enhance the firm's environment, social, "
            'and governance (ESG) ratings and create a legacy in the highly '
            'lucrative green energy industry that will help it attract many '
            'foreign investors. However, Sonam Srivastava, Founder at Wright '
            'Research, cautioned if the mega plan is well executed, it will up '
            'the firms credibility. But funding for this mega plan will be the '
            'key thing to watch.',

            'On a sequential basis, the revenue rose 11 percent from the net '

            'revenue of Rs 1,31,985 crore for last year. With record '
            'profitability in the fourth quarter, we had a very good end to '
            'the year and we attribute Hindalcos highest-ever profits not just '
            'to strong macros, but also our consistent focus on operational '
            'excellence and cost optimization, said Satish Pai, managing '
            'director of the company. Hindalco continue to remain one of the '
            'worlds lowest cost and highest EBITDA margin producers of '
            'aluminium. Our strategy to build a more sustainable business '
            'model that is isolated from metal cycles is working very well for '
            'us. In line with this, we have allocated over 70 percent of our '
            'growth capex to value-enhancing downstream segments and all our '
            'growth capex for the next five years will be funded out of '
            'internal accruals, Pai added. All the business segments of the '
            'company witnessed strong growth during the quarter, aided by both '
            'the higher global commodity prices as well as higher volumes '
            'which more than absorbed the high cost of production. The total '
            'shipments of flat rolled products (FRPs) were up at 987 Kilotons '
            '(kt) as compared to 983 kt in Q4 FY21. Revenue stood at $4.8 '
            'billion (vs $3.6 billion), up 34 percent YoY, driven by higher '
            'global aluminium prices. The business reported quarterly adjusted '
            'EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and '
            'amortization) of $431 million, down 15 percent on year from $505 '
            'million. Net income stood at $217 million, up 21percent YoY, due '
            'to lower interest expense in Q4 FY22. The aluminium production '
            'for its India business stood at 326 Kt as compared to 316 Kt in '
            'the corresponding quarter. Aluminium sales inched up 2 percent '
            'YoY at 336 Kt compared to 329 Kt in the prior year. Aluminium VAP '
            '(excluding wire rods) sales volumes were at 93 Kt, up 1 percent '
            'YoY from 92 Kt during the prior year period, driven by recovery '
            'of the domestic market. VAP sales, as a percentage of total metal '
            'sales, were at 28 percent this quarter, which was the same as the '
            'prior year quarter. The business recorded revenue of Rs 9,847 '
            'crore during the reported quarter compared to Rs 5,969 crore in '
            'the prior year period. The India aluminium business registered an '
            'all-time high EBITDA of Rs 4,050 crore compared with Rs 1,819 '
            'crore during the same period last year, a year on year increase '
            'of 123 percent. The growth was primarily due to favourable '

{'article': ' Ltd reported a 31.4 percent decline in the fourth quarter of '

            'the highest ever net profit in the year ended March. The '
            'state-run oil marketing company reported revenue of Rs 2,06,461 '
            'crore during the quarter under review, as compared to Rs 1,63,733 '
            'crore logged in the corresponding quarter of the previous '
            'financial year. For the year 2021-22, the company reported a '
            'record high revenue of Rs 728,460 crore as against Rs 5,14,890 '
            'crore in the previous financial year, riding high on the surge in '
            "crude oil prices. The fourth quarter's bottomline was dented by a "
            'margin squeeze in petrochemicals and a loss in auto fuel sales. '
            'For the most part of this quarter, IOCL, and other state-run oil '
            'marketing companies, left the price of auto fuel unchanged '
            'despite the benchmark crude oil prices soaring to a 14-year high '
            'of $140 a barrel in early March. While prices of fuel sold to '
            'bulk consumers and aviation turbine fuel were raised, retail '
            'prices of petrol and diesel were left unchanged for almost 137 '
            'days. The OMCs resumed increasing the prices only from March 22. '
            'IOCs pre-tax earnings from the sale of petroleum products '
            'declined by 8 percent to Rs 8,251.29 crore in the March quarter, '
            'while that for its petrochemicals business fell 72 percent to Rs '
            '570.18 crore. This was despite an increase in revenue from '
            'petroleum products to Rs 197, 724.49 crore in Q4FY22 from Rs '
            '157,109.11 crore a year ago, and an increase in petrochemical '
            'revenue to Rs 8,009.59 crore, from Rs 6,382.61 a year ago. The '
            'company reported a robust refining margin in the quarter but the '
            'impact was offset by a narrowing of margin in petrochemicals and '
            'a loss in auto fuel sales. The average gross refining margin '
            '(GRM) for the year FY22 stood at $11.25 per barrel (bbl) as '
            'against $5.64 per bbl a year ago. The core GRM or the current '
            'price GRM for FY22 after offsetting the impact of inventory gain '
            'stands at $7.61 per bbl. GRM is the margin that refiners earn '

            'structural narratives on revenue growth of Dabur are highly '

            'On the flipside, a series of resistances could be seen starting '
            'from 17,500 to 17,800 in the comparable period, he said. '
            'Considering the recent price action, the market expert advised '
            'traders not to carry aggressive overnight bets for a while and, '
            'instead, adopt the strategy of one-step-at-a-time and respect '
            "levels on either side. Let's take a look at the top 10 trading "
            'ideas by experts for the next three-four weeks. Returns are based '
            'on the September 23 closing prices: After a higher level of '
            'reversal (from Rs 3,974 to Rs 3,446), the stock respected its '
            'prior multiple lows (Rs 3,450) connecting horizontal trendline '
            'and resumed its up-move. On September 23, the stock rose to an '
            'eight-day high of Rs 3,700, where volume was above average. Its '
            'daily RSI (relative strength index) is positively poised above '
            'the 50 mark. As per the current set-up, we believe the stock will '
            'continue its up-move. We believe the stock has the potential to '
            'surpass its downward sloping 100-day SMA (simple moving average '
            'of Rs 3,734), which could lead it towards prior swing high (Rs '
            '3,974) initially and its 200-day SMA (Rs 4,069) subsequently. On '
            'the lower side, the stock will continue to find support around '
            'its prior multiple lows connecting horizontal trendline. The '
            'stock reversed after testing its prior highs (Rs 542 and Rs 549) '
            'connecting rising trendline and breached its weekly rising trend. '
            'The stock formed a bearish reversal pattern-Shooting Star-right '
            'after deliberation pattern. The key technical indicators gave '
            'sell signal after bearish divergence on the short-term timeframe '
            'chart. This could drag the stock towards Rs 516-500-486, which '
            'coincides with its 20-week EMA (exponential moving average), '
            'psychological level and its 50-week EMA. In case of any rebound, '
            'its prior highs connecting rising trendline will cap the up-move. '
            'The stock formed a bearish reversal pattern-Double Top around Rs '
            '128 and poised for a down move. Again its weekly RSI reversed '
            'after testing 70-mark. In the past, the stock suffered a sharp '
            'decline after an identical formation in its weekly RSI. Since May '
            '2019, the stock witnessed sharp reversals and reported fall '
            'between 24-28 percent from its respective peaks at least three '
            'times. As is said, history repeats itself, I feel, it could drag '
            'the stock towards its psychological level (Rs 100) initially and '
            'trendline support (Rs 92) subsequently. In case of any rebound, '
            'the stock will face hurdle around its Double Top formation. '
            'Rossari Biotech has witnessed a very sharp correction of 51 '
            'percent between October 2021 and June 2022. Since then the stock '
            'has been consolidating at Rs 825-880 (see chart) and it has made '
            'a solid base near Rs 900 levels. On August 3, 2022, it gave a '
            'classic breakout from said levels along with massive volume '
            'picking up which hints at further upside. At current juncture, '
            'the said counter has taken support near its top of the previous '
            'range breakout. One can hold (if already bought) and add (if '
            'considering fresh buy) at the current market price. Upside is '
            'seen till Rs 1,050 with credible support at Rs 885. On the daily '
            'chart, NMDC has been making higher highs and higher lows since '
            'the last couple of months. Also volume is picking up on a daily '
            'basis which is complementing its up move. From the indicator '
            'perspective, the weekly RSI (relative strength index) is above 50 '
            'along with weekly stochastics overbought, which further confirms '
            'upside in counter. One can buy in small tranches at current '
            'levels and buy another tranche at around Rs 121-122 levels (if '
            'again tested). Upside is expected till Rs 145 and support is seen '
            'around Rs 117. Pfizer has seen a free fall since September 2021 '
            'till June 2022 which resulted in a 31 percent correction. Since '
            'then, the stock has been consolidating between Rs 4,000 and Rs '
            '4,200 besides making higher highs and higher lows and it has made '
            'a solid base near Rs 4,200. On the indicator front, the weekly '
            'RSI has shown bullish divergence (refer chart) which is adding '
            'more confirmation for further upside in the counter. One can hold '
            '(if already bought) and add (if considering fresh buy) at the '
            'current market price. Upside is seen till Rs 4,700 with credible '
            'support seen at Rs 3,950. In the last one-and-a-half months, the '
            'stock has consolidated within a channel and prices have given a '
            'breakdown below the support in Fridays session. The prices have '
            'also closed below its 20 DEMA support and thus we could see an '
            'underperformance in the stock in the near term. The RSI '

            'three Asiatic cheetahs were hunted down in 1948 and the cheetah '

            'jubatus venaticus) and the subspecies being introduced in the '
            'country is the African Cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus jubatus). '
            'Research has shown that the genes of these two subspecies are the '

            'end of September 2022 compared to just 18 buys a year ago. One of '
            'Indias largest private life insurers,  , occupied the second spot '
            'amongst the stocks that received the maximum upgrades in the past '
            'one year. Its annual premium equivalent (APE) and value of new '
            'business (VNB) are showing a healthy growth while the execution '
            'of Exide Life Insurance will provide additional tailwinds. As a '
            'result, 32 analysts have a buy on this company compared to 27 a '
            'year ago. FMCG and cigarette giant  is riding a strong wave '
            'across its business segments. The key growth drivers for the '
            'company are its focus on de-risking business model by reducing '
            'dependence on the core cigarette business (affected by regulatory '
            'and tax hurdles) and scaling up FMCG business; ITC Infotech '

            'third spot as it now has 35 buys compared to 28 a year ago. '
            'Riding the auto theme, the other two big companies from the '

            'which is also the biggest Indian company by market capitalization '
            'along with the jewellery maker,   occupied the fifth and sixth '
            'spots. Reliance Industries received the most upgrades in the last '
            'one quarter driven by its renewable energy, 5G and retail push. '
            'The growth momentum and improved margin profile across the sector '
            'will drive RILs revenue growth of 25 percent and EBITDA growth of '
            '32 percent in FY23, said the analysts at Motilal Oswal Financial '
            'Service. These, however, do not factor in any incremental growth '
            'from 5G capex, new energy and other segments. According to a note '
            'from Motilal Oswal, Over the next two-to-three years, RIL is '
            'likely to create the next engine of growth but it could put '
            'pressure on its near-term return ratios. Reliance received 7.2 '
            'percent upgrades during the quarter and was followed by ITC Ltd '
            'and HDFC Life Insurance for which the upgrades in percentage '
            'terms stood at 5.6 and 5.2 percent respectively. The other two '
            'companies that received the most rating upgrades during the '
            'quarter were Eicher Motors and Titan Company Ltd. Titan is well '
            'placed to capitalize on long term growth opportunities led by '
            'jewellery share gains due to network expansion, regional thrust '
            'and hallmarking benefits; Omni-channel strategy across jewellery, '
            'watches and eyewear; new growth drivers like Caratlane, Titan '
            'Eye+, Taneira and entry into high growth segments like wearables '
            'such as smart watches, over the head headphones and Truly '
            'Wireless earphones, research firm Prabhudas Liladhar said in a '
            'report. HDFC Life Insurance garnered maximum rating upgrades in '
            'the past one month amounting to 5.9 percent growth over the '
            'previous month. It was followed by Reliance Industries and Eicher '
            'Motors which managed an increase of 2.1 percent each over the '
            'month of August 2022.  ,   followed Eicher Motors with close 1 '
            'percent jump in buy ratings. According to analysts at Incred '
            'Equities, Bajaj Finances digital transformation is visible in the '
            'form of superior client addition and improved turnaround time '
            'with almost zero manual intervention and, this will result in a '
            'gradual improvement in operating leverage and lower credit cost '
            '(below ~2%), resulting in superior return ratios. The commodity '
            'prices saw their dream run end as the world economy braces for a '
            'slowdown. The experts are apprehensive of the demand revival '
            'especially in the steel sector and the revival of production in '
            'China will be an added negative for Indian steel producers. '
            'Consequently,   tops the list of maximum downgrades during the '
            "past one year. It saw a 35 percent increase in its downgrades', "
            'while Indias largest steel producer,  , saw a reduction of 14.7 '
            'percent in its buy calls. At the same time, the uncertainty '
            'surrounding the growth of global economy, has also dimmed the '
            'prospects of Indian IT companies. The tech giants of India, '
            'namely,  ,   and   saw their downgrades increase by 29.8, 18.4 '
            'and 16 percent respectively. ,   and   were the other '
            'constituents of this list. Britannia topped the list of maximum '
            'downgrades during the last quarter as its rating downgrades '
            'increased by 16.7 percent. The buy calls on the stock have gone '
            'down from 26 three months ago to 20 currently. Despite the '
            'company raising prices to offset the commodity price rise, Volume '
            'growth acceleration along with improvement in margin will be a '
            'tough task in the current challenging environment, a note from '
            'HDFC Securities said. Second on the list is the state run ONGC '
            'which the ratings downgrades increased by 15 percent in the '
            'quarter from 23 buys a quarter ago to 18 now. The hold calls on '
            'this navratna company have gone up from 3 to 7 in the past one '
            'quarter. The companys overseas arm, ONGC Videsh Ltd, is facing '
            'problems due to the sanctions on Russia. It has three assets in '
            'Russia at Sakhalin (20 percent stake), JSC Vankomeft (26 percent '
            'stake) and Imperial Energy (100 percent subsidiary). The ongoing '
            'Russia-Ukraine war have not only created demand supply '
            'constraints but have also affected its overseas subsidiary ONGC '
            'Videshs activities in Russia and therefore, taking a cautious '
            'view, we lower our rating on the stock to Hold, said a report '
            'from Geojit Retail Equity Research. The Indian IT sector is '
            'bracing itself for the expected cut down in IT spending by the '
            'global organisations in the wake of rising interest rates and '
            'increased monetary tightening. Tech Mahindra, one of the top 5 IT '
            'services providers is expected to feel pressure on its margins in '

            'downgrade and hold ratings while the buy calls have gone down by '
            '14 percent in the past one quarter. Apart from energy and '

            'list. Two wheeler major,   has seen its downgrades increase the '

            'Nigeria, although difficult to implement, remains a key concern, '
            'HDFC Securities Institutional Research said in a note. BPCL and '

            'economy. Mid- and small-caps are more exposed to how the economy '
            'does. As things get better on the economic front, we believe mid- '
            'and small-caps will do well. Even in terms of valuations, we are '
            'seeing better opportunities in select mid- and small-caps '
            'compared to large-caps, said Lohchab, speaking with CNBC TV-18 on '
            'September 8. He added that HDFC Securities is positive on the '
            'Indian economy from a 12 to 18 month view. His optimism comes at '
            'a time when major western economies are likely to enter a '
            'recession due to the fallout of war in Ukraine. The market in '
            'those countries has already sensed the doom and the selling has '
            'deepened. Meanwhile, the Indian market has outperformed them by a '
            'wide margin. However, this unchecked rally has made headline '
            'indices more expensive than others. Nifty currently trades at a '
            'trailing PE of 22 times and 1-year forward PE of 20.56. This is '
            'about double of how Hong Kong and Taiwan trade. It is also '
            'significantly more expensive than Jakarta, US and Japan that '
            'trade in the range of 15-17 times their 1-year forward PE. At an '
            "index level we don't see a runaway sort of opportunity given the "
            "fact it's already trading at 21-22 times, said Lohchab, "

            'Mathur, sat down for an exclusive interview with Moneycontrols '
            "Rachita Prasad. Edited excerpts follow:  What we've done with "
            'MindSphere is to collect data in a very standardised format '
            'through digital application, which is a good start because it was '
            'all about predictive maintenance and preventative maintenance of '
            'machinery. This is how the whole digitalisation game started in '
            'production. Now, we really have taken this to the next level; '
            "we're talking about design and engineering. This is where "
            'production and engineering can grow together. It can '
            'significantly accelerate the process. Customers are no longer '
            'interested in just the manufacturing, they are asking for digital '
            'transformation that will bring all the data together from '
            'different silos from manufacturing, service, design in order to '
            "make it seamless. With Xcelerator, we're going to take on this "
            'challenge to make data flow through all the different '
            'applications seamlessly.  A couple of years ago, we were chasing '
            "customers to say why don't you move from automation to "
            'digitalisation, and now it is the other way around. The pandemic '
            'has only accelerated it a little bit, but it started a couple of '
            'years prior to the pandemic. We began to see the benefits that '
            'come out of it. And I think now we are at a stage to take it to '
            'the next level; in fact, all our businesses are doing '
            "digitalisation to some extent already. : It's a global platform. "
            'We are building partners to develop the ecosystem. India is '
            'playing a huge role in the development of all the solutions that '
            'go on Xcelerator. We launched a software called Building X that '
            'has been developed by engineers in Bangalore. I dare to say that '
            'almost any solution that we are going to develop in the future '
            'will be touched somehow by software engineers in India. We have '
            'around 6,000 software engineers in India who work with us for our '
            'global product development.  There are platforms and there are '
            'platforms. The platform that L&T or Adani or the others do is '
            "very different from what we're doing. We understand the processes "
            'from mobility, trade, manufacturing, to food and beverages, to '
            'farming, etcetera. That is not the ecosystem that the others are '
            'working in. We are able to start from design right through to '
            'post-manufacturing performance, and help the customer be '
            'effective there. There are big customers who can afford to take '
            'those major steps, and then there are small, and medium '
            'enterprises who cannot afford to and are nervous about spending '
            "money upfront because they don't know what the outcome will be. "
            'That is where a platform like this adds an even greater benefit '
            "to them. Because we've got standardised solutions which dont "
            "require major capex.  For SMEs, it is important because it's "
            "SaaS, no capex, and is very easy to deploy, because we don't have "
            'to put it on their servers. As for the customer base, the first '

            'an organic basis and (2) 20 bps contribution from Thirdware '

            'Seasonal weakness in Comviva will lead to weaker growth in '
            'telecom," Kotak Institutional Equities. The lower revenue growth, '
            'wage hike, an increase in travel expenses will be impacting the '
            'operating margin of the company during the quarter ended June '
            '2022. Kotak expects an EBIT margin decline of 210 bps QoQ and 400 '
            'bps YoY. "Sequential decline can be attributed to(1) 120 bps from '
            'wage revision, (2) 90-100 bps from an increase in visa costs and '
            'Comviva seasonality, and (3) 50 bps+ from an increase in travel '
            'and G&A costs." ICICI Direct also feels EBIT margin is expected '
            'to decline by 206 bps QoQ on a sequential basis owing to wage '
            'revision, retention expenses, and increasing travel expenses, '

            "completed buyout of Swiss major Holcim's stake in the two firms. "
            "Calling the acquisition historic, he said this buyout is India's "
            'largest ever inbound M&A transaction in the infrastructure and '
            'materials space and closed in a record time of 4 months. "Our '
            'entry into this business is happening at a time when India is on '
            'the cusp of one of the greatest economic surges seen in the '
            'modern world," he said in the speech, which was released on '
            'Monday. Stating reasons for the foray into the cement space, he '
            'said while India is the second largest producer of cement in the '
            'world, its per capita consumption is just 250 kg compared to '
            '1,600 kg of China. "This is almost a 7x headroom for growth." '
            'Also, "as several of the government\'s programmes gather '
            'momentum, the long-term average growth in cement demand is '
            'expected to be 1.2 to 1.5 times the GDP. We anticipate growing at '
            'twice this number," he said. With trillion-dollar investment '
            'planned in infrastructure and housing in the country, cement is '
            'an attractive "adjacency to our infrastructure business, '
            "especially the group's ports and logistics business, green energy "
            'business, and the e-commerce platform being developed," he said. '
            "Adani Group's competency in driving operational efficiency will "
            'result in "significant margin expansion to become the most '
            'profitable cement manufacturer in the country," he said. "And we '
            'anticipate going from the current 70 million tonne capacity to '
            '140 million tonne in next 5 years." On his group\'s growth '
            "philosophy, Adani, 60, said it is the belief in India's growth "
            'story. India will be a USD 25-30 trillion economy by 2050, which '
            'points to huge growth prospects, he said. The group is the '
            "world's largest solar power company and has committed USD 70 "
            'billion investment in clean energy business including green '
            'hydrogen, he said. Adani Group is the largest airport operator in '
            'the nation with 25 per cent of passenger traffic and 40 per cent '
            'of air cargo. It is the largest ports and logistics company in '
            'the country with a 30 per cent market share. "We are India\'s '
            'largest integrated energy player spanning generation, '
            'transmission, distribution, LNG, LPG, city gas and piped gas '
            'distribution. Each of these businesses is growing at double-digit '
            'rates," he said. While the group has won some of the largest road '
            'contracts in the country and is on the way to becoming the '
            'largest player in this sector, a grand IPO of Adani Wilmar has '
            'made it the highest-valued FMCG company in the country. "We have '
            'declared our path forward in multiple new sectors that include '
            'data centers, super apps, aerospace and defence, industrial '
            'clouds, metals, and petrochemicals," he said. "Our finances are '
            'stronger than ever before, and we continue to raise billions of '
            'dollars from international markets and strategic partners to '
            'further accelerate our growth."',

{'article': 'reported resilient profitability metrics for Q4FY22, which was '
            'reflected in the more than 1 percent increase in the companys '
            'stock price after the release of the results. The life insurer '
            'reported a net profit of Rs 357.52 crore, up 12.4 percent from a '
            'year ago. Street expectations were of a profit after tax of Rs '
            '355 crore for the said quarter. The net profit came on the back '
            'of 11 percent growth in net premium income, which stood at Rs '
            '14,289.6 crore. Expenses of management rose 15 percent even as '
            'net commissions fell by 3.88 percent to Rs 620.7 crore for the '
            'quarter. Operating expenses as a percentage of total premium rose '
            'marginally to 12.3 percent from 12 percent a year ago. More '
            'importantly, the life insurers value of new business grew by 22 '
            'percent for FY22, higher than the14 percent growth seen in FY21. '
            'Yet another important profitability metric, the new business '
            'margin, showed a sharp improvement as well. New business margin '
            'rose to 27.4 percent for FY22 from 26.1 percent the previous '
            'year. HDFC Life has consistently shown improvement in its new '
            'business margin and at the current level, the companys margins '
            'are highest in the industry. For the quarter, our new business '
            'margin is 29.3 percent. We are very proud of our achievement '
            'here, said Vibha Padalkar, managing director and chief executive '
            'officer of the company said in an interaction with Moneycontrol. '
            'The life insurer was also able to sustain growth, and gained 10 '
            'basis points in market share during the quarter. HDFC Lifes '
            'retail weighted received premium grew by 16 percent and on an '
            'annualised premium equivalent (APE) basis the growth was 15 '
            'percent year-on-year. Total APE witnessed a growth of 17 percent '
            'for FY22. That said, the life insurers growth metrics were below '
            'the private sector life insurance industrys growth of 22 percent '
            'for the year. Part of the reason could be a slight deceleration '
            'in its protection business. Protection showed a growth of 24 '
            'percent in terms of APE but on a shrunken base. In FY21, '
            'protection had slipped 16 percent. That said, a favourable mix of '
            'policies ensured that the companys new business margins showed '
            'improvement. The share of market linked plans increased '
            'marginally to 26 percent while that of participatory products '
            'decreased to 30 percent from 34 percent a year ago. HDFC Life not '
            'only could get more customers but also could make them stick with '
            'it. Persistency ratios improved in FY22 across tenures. The 13  '

            'counter the 15 percent duty imposed on steel exports in the '
            'middle of the quarter and we continue to drive value accretive '
            'growth in India backed by investments in customer relationships, '
            'brands and distribution networks and remain well positioned to '
            'benefit from the buoyant automotive & retail housing demand and '
            'the government spend on infrastructure, he added. The companys '
            'European business delivered a sharp improvement in performance as '
            'long term contracts and product mix helped drive a strong '
            'increase in realizations. The company produced 7.74 MT (million '
            'tons) of steel during the quarter on a consolidated basis which '
            'was 1.8 percent lower as compared to 7.88 MT produced during the '

            'factors. The sales volume during the quarter came in at 6.62 MT '
            'which was 7 percent lower on year and 17.4 percent lower on a '
            'sequential basis. Revenue per ton for India operations rose by '
            'Rs. 8,534 QoQ to Rs. 83,625 per ton while Revenue per ton for its '
            'European operations increased by 154 QoQ to 1,248 per ton aided '

{'article': ', the countrys biggest steel producer, has announced the merger '
            'of seven of its subsidiaries with itself, excluding Neelachal '
            'Ispat Nigam Ltd (NINL), which it recently acquired. The merger is '
            'a big positive for streamlining the overall group structure, '
            'enabling efficient utilisation of facilities and optimisation of '
            'procurement and working capital management, analysts said. '
            'However, they do not see any value addition or value creation for '
            'the time being due to the merger. Post the merger, Tata Steel '
            'management expects a saving of around Rs 700800 crore on a net '
            'present value (NPV) basis on royalty payments it currently has to '
            'make for iron ore supplies to these subsidiaries. However, these '
            'savings are dependent on the prices of iron ore in Odisha and '
            'Jharkhand where the mines are located. According to a report from '
            'the research firm Motilal Oswal, Tata is currently paying an '
            'additional royalty of 22.5 percent of IBM (Indian Bureau of '
            'Mines) prices for the quantum of iron ore supplied to Tata Steel '
            'Long Products (TSLP) and Tata Steel Mining Ltd (TSML). This is '
            'over and above the normal royalty paid to National Mineral '
            'Exploration Trust (NMET) and District Mineral Foundation (DMF) '
            'already paid for the iron ore dispatched from its mines. This '
            'normal royalty works out to 19.8 percent. The group will also '
            'save on other regulatory costs like audits, filings/compliances '
            'under various Acts which are not only costly but also '
            'time-consuming, especially in cases where the size of operations '
            'does not justify the regulatory costs, said the Motilal Oswal '
            'report. Analysts say the amalgamation may not add/create much '
            'value in terms of profitability except for the savings on royalty '
            'and regulatory costs. We believe the merger is broadly '
            'value-neutral at the proposed swap ratios, said a report from BOB '
            'Capital Markets. While it will result in 2.2 percent dilution of '
            'Tata Steels shares, this would largely be offset by a lower share '
            'of the minority interest in earnings and modest cost savings of '
            'Rs 700 crore pre-tax mainly on account of additional royalty that '
            'is currently payable by Tata Steel on the sale of captive iron '
            'ore. Post the announcement of the merger, the brokerages are not '
            'yet making any revisions to their estimates. They would like to '
            'wait for the completion of the merger and see how the synergies '
            'play out. We note that Tata Steel has been trying to merge TSLP '
            'and TTML, among other companies, for a while but had been unable '
            'to consummate the same and hence, we will wait for further '
            'clarity on the completion of these mergers, said the Motilal '
            'Oswal report. The brokerage would also like to understand the '
            'timeline for the merger as the company has just made the '
            'announcement in this regard and would also seek greater clarity '

            'share to Rs 95 per share on the back of lower price-to-book (PB) '
            'valuations and a better outlook on cash flows. Motilal Oswal has '
            'a neutral on the stock with a target price of Rs 106 per share as '
            'it estimates the stock trading at 4.3x EV/EBITDA for FY23 and '

{'article': 'Hindustan Zinc (HZ)s revenue was in line at INR94b (up 44% YoY '
            'and 7% QoQ) in 1QFY23, led by higher LME prices but partly offset '
            'by flat lead prices, repeating the trend of 4QFY22. EBITDA stood '
            'in line at INR51b (up 44% YoY and 4% QoQ). Power and fuel costs '
            'were at INR9b, up 15% QoQ, led by higher coal prices as FSA '
            'materialization was only 8% during the quarter and the company '
            'continued to import the balance coal from Australia and '
            'Indonesia. HZs PAT grew 46% YoY and 6% QoQ to INR31b, in line '
            'with our estimate of INR32b, as lower-than-estimated other income '
            'was offset by lower-thanestimated finance cost. The company used '
            'about 50% of the hedges for FY23 during 1QFY23 and the balance is '
            'likely to be exhausted in 2QFY23E. The effective realization for '
            '2HFY23E is likely to be lower as zinc prices have also corrected '
            'sharply. Refined zinc sales declined 4% QoQ to 206kt while '
            'refined lead sales rose 10% QoQ to 54kt. Silver sales, at 177 '
            'tonnes, rose 9% QoQ. With China continuing to battle Covid while '
            'rest of the world battles inflation, we believe there are no '
            'significant positive triggers for HZ. Hence, we maintain our '
            'Neutral rating on the stock. At 17:30 Hindustan Zinc was quoting '

            'expected to report a PAT of Rs 264 crore on consolidated revenue '

            'business. International tea business is likely to witness a YoY '

            'coffee (EOC + Vietnam FDC) in INR terms while the revenues for '
            'NourishCo are estimated at Rs 165 crore, analysts at Kotak said. '

            'PAT during the previous quarter was Rs 87.5 crore, which had an '
            'impairment loss of Rs 751.5 crore. Adjusting for the impairment, '
            'PAT would have been Rs 839 crore while revenue was Rs 5,437 '
            'crore. The brokerages forecast a healthy year-on-year growth in '
            'revenue from its US business, which is likely to grow 15 percent '
            'to $260-270 million. The growth was aided by the ramp-up in '
            'prescription share of generic versions of Vascepa (a drug to '
            'treat high triglyceride levels), Vasostrict (to increase blood '
            'pressure in adults), Ciprodex (for ear infections) and other '

            'Vasostrict, as well as base business erosion. Domestic sales, '
            'however, are likely to dip 5-10 percent on a high Covid base '
            'during the same period last year. The acquisition of the Cidmus '
            'brand supported domestic business growth to some extent during '

            'mid-single digit YoY growth in Europe and the rest of the world, '
            'and in the pharmaceutical services and active ingredients '
            'segments. While underlying Russia sales will decline sequentially '
            'on account of stocking up in Q4FY22, we expect appreciation of '

            'revenues are seen rising 22 percent when it announces earnings '
            'for July-September 2022 on October 14. According to a poll of '
            'brokerages conducted by Moneycontrol, the company is expected to '
            'report a standalone PAT of Rs 260 crore while clocking standalone '
            'revenues of Rs 3,917 crore in Q2. The company had posted a PAT of '
            'Rs 578 crore during the corresponding period of last year when '
            'its standalone revenues stood at Rs 3,206 crore. The net profit '
            'during the previous quarter of the current fiscal stood at Rs 316 '
            'crore on revenues of Rs 4,203 crore. Analysts expect Shrees '
            'cement volumes to grow 18 percent on year to 7.5 million tonne '
            '(MT) while on a sequential basis they are seen declining '
            'marginally by 1 percent. We estimate volume of 7.4 MT (+18.5 '
            'percent YoY, -0.7 percent QoQ) during the quarter, factoring '
            'seasonality and backended recovery in demand during the quarter, '
            'said analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities. The blended '
            'realisations are likely to improve 6-7 percent on year but '
            'compared to the previous quarter they are forecast to dip 4 '
            'percent due to lower exit prices and rollback of price hikes. '
            'Earlier Shree Cement was most efficient in managing operating '
            'costs, which gave it an edge over the competition. However, now '
            'the competition has caught up and the company seems to have lost '
            'that edge. The rise in petroleum coke and coal prices and use of '
            'high-cost inventory will severely impact the prospects of cement '
            'players in the country and consequently, for Shree Cement, the '
            'variable costs are likely to surge about 80 percent as compared '
            'to the previous year period. This would expand the operating '
            'costs per tonne by close to 24-28 percent. We expect the variable '
            'cost per tonne to increase by 82 percent YoY, resulting in a 28 '
            'percent rise in operating expenses per tonne, said a report from '
            'Motilal Oswal Financial Services. As a result, cement earnings '
            'before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) per '

            'works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only '
            'induces immune response to protect people from any future '
            'COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to '
            'put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a '
            'sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a '
            'disease, making the spread of disease from person to person '
            'unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly '
            'stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. There are '
            'broadly four types of vaccine  one, a vaccine based on the whole '
            'virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated '
            '[weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector '
            'vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the '
            'antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have '
            'genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein '
            'given to a person, helping  human cells decode genetic material '
            'and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine '
            'wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an '
            'adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. Vaccine development is '
            'a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people '
            'with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also '
            'vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the '
            'elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the '
            'fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it '
            'usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. Erallier this '
            'week, the company also said one of its consortium signed a formal '
            'contract for Rs 860 crore with NewSpace India Limited for '
            'realisation of five PSLV-XL Launch Vehicles. Analysts are also '
            'upbeat on the stock. ICICI Securities in a note published on '
            'August 30 said it sees strong order visibility for HAL and '

            'private sector capex. These include cyclical improvement in '
            'demand and capacity utilisation, cleaner corporate and financial '
            'sector balance sheets, structural reforms such as corporate tax '
            'rate reduction, implementation of Production-Linked Incentive '
            '(PLI) schemes and focus on infrastructure and supply-chain '
            'diversification. The corporate sector continues to deleverage its '
            'balance sheets with the corporate debt to GDP ratio expected at '
            '47 percent in FY23 from a peak of 62 percent in FY15, Morgan '
            'Stanley added. It expects the corporate debt growth to surpass '
            'nominal GDP growth in FY24 after staying below it in the past '
            "nine years. The banking sector's balance sheet position between "
            'FY10 to FY18 was constrained as impaired loans continued to '
            'increase, peaking at 12.4 percent of bank assets in FY18. '
            'Impaired loans have now decelerated to a 10-year low of 7.5 '
            'percent in FY22, indicating an improving balance sheet position '
            'to fund the capex cycle, said Morgan Stanley. It is also seeing '
            'an inflection in credit growth with better domestic demand. '
            'Year-to-date credit is growing at one of the highest rates in 10 '
            'years. Year-on-year (YoY) credit growth was 15.3 percent as of '
            'August 22, partly because of a low base. However, we note that '
            'trailing three-year credit growth has accelerated to 8.7 percent '
            'as against 6.8 percent as of end March 2022 and retail/SME demand '
            'has resumed and capacity utilisation has improved which has led '
            'to normalization of loan growth at Indian banks. The government '
            'has shown strong intent to push structural reforms. The policy '
            'reforms have been meaningful, starting with the significant '
            'reduction in the corporate tax rate, the introduction of fiscal '
            'incentives under the PLI schemes for the manufacturing sector, '
            'expansion of public infrastructure spending and opening up of new '
            'sectors for private businesses. The recent spate of supply-chain '
            'disruptions in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic and '
            'geopolitical tensions have brought to the fore the vagaries of '
            'dependence on a few sources of supply. Global companies are '
            'making a shift toward a "China plus" strategy to reduce their '
            'dependence on that country and India is one of the biggest '
            'potential beneficiaries of the shift. Indeed, we are seeing signs '
            'of improvement in foreign direct investment (FDI) flows, '
            'multinational corporation (MNC) sentiment and more news flow '
            'suggesting India should benefit from relocation of supply chains, '
            'the investment bank added. It expects Indias export market share '
            'to more than double to 4.5 percent by 2030 from 2.2 percent '
            'currently. After the pandemic brought the global economy to a '
            'standstill, the complete reopening of the economy is enabling a '
            'strong recovery in India. The recovery has been the strongest in '
            'almost a decade. It is the breadth of the recovery where we are '
            'seeing growth firing on almost all cylinders, which is very '
            'encouraging, said the report. The strength of the economy can '
            'also be gauged from the improvement in key economic indicators '
            'like the Composite Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) and a surge in '
            'Goods and Services Tax collections. Growth in car and two- '
            'wheeler sales compared to pre-COVID levels has been more than 30 '
            'percent each, new property sales and launches have reached 11- '
            'and 8-year highs respectively and capacity utilisation rose to '
            '75.3 percent in the first quarter of the current financial year. '
            'According to Morgan Stanleys proprietary MNC Sentiment Index, '
            'which has a strong association with FDI inflows, corporate '
            'profits and the direction of share prices, the sentiment towards '
            'India is close to all-time highs. Relative to China, where we run '
            'a similar index, India took its outperformance to an all-time '
            'high, it added. The report stated that from a geographical '
            'perspective, the improvement in sentiment was led by the US and '
            'Japan. From a sector perspective, real estate, materials, '
            'communication services and industrials outperformed, whereas '
            'energy, utilities and consumer staples and technology were the '
            'laggards. The investment bank estimates that the overall '
            'investment rate will rise to 36 percent of GDP by FY27 from '
            'around 31 percent of GDP in FY22. This implies that total '
            'investment growth (nominal) will average around 16.7 percent in '
            'the next five years compared to average growth of 8.8 percent in '
            'the previous five years. Risks to the banks outlook emerge from '
            'external factors such as a sharper-than-anticipated slowdown in '
            'global growth and or a sharp rise in commodity prices, '
            'particularly oil prices, which can impact business confidence. '
            'Corporate profits still have steam left to go grow for the next '
            'few years. The most important ingredient in profits is the rate '
            'of investment. In turn, higher profits drive investments, '
            'creating a virtuous cycle of higher wages, more consumption, more '
            'investments and more profits. The profit cycle breaks when '
            'investments start getting unproductive or "excessive" but that '
            'point is a few years away, said the investment bank. As '
            'investments rise, profit share in GDP (aka profit margin) will '
            'likely go past its previous high which means Indian stocks are '
            'not as rich as they appear on a headline basis. Given the '
            'perception that growth may be accelerating, led by investments, '
            'Morgan Stanley thinks domestic cyclical sectors could do well '
            'relative to external-facing sectors or defensive ones. '
            'Accordingly, we prefer industrials, financials and consumer '
            'discretionary. We are also overweight on these sectors in our '
            'sector model portfolio with a 12-18 month view, it said. '
            'Industrials are likely benefiting from strong capex plus '
            'inexpensive valuations, while for financials, rising interest '
            'rates support margins, low leverage levels in the economy and '
            'rising capex favour a loan boom and benign credit costs further '
            'boost earnings. Consumer discretionary valuations look '
            'attractive, given expectations of strong growth in the coming '
            'months. Long-term fundamentals are robust, underpinned by rising '
            'incomes. Among the stocks, the investment banks top picks are , '
            'and in the EPC (erection, procurement and construction) and '
            'capital goods segments. It expects a few industrial goods '
            'companies likeHavells, , and to benefit fromimproving real estate '
            'cycle and rising electrification. In the financial space, it '
            'believes that retail deposits and competitive intensity will be '
            'high, and the ability to gain deposit market share gains will be '
            'the key. Large banks like and are best placed to capitalize on '
            'this.',

{'article': ' Ltd (GCPL) expects consumption to improve in the second half of '

            'Indonesia," it said. However, with significant correction in the '

            'Europe and South Africa and are expected to report a healthy YoY '
            'growth. We expect Cipla to report a 5 percent YoY decline in '
            'domestic sales in Q1FY23 on account of a high Covid-led base. '
            'Excluding Covid, we expect domestic sales to grow by 9 percent on '
            'year," Kotak Institutional Equities analysts said in a report. '
            'The brokerage expects US sales at $156 million, up 11 percent on '
            'year albeit down 2 percent sequentially even as Lanreotide '
            '(launched in March 2022) continues to scale up. Brokerage firm '
            'Motilal Oswal Financial Services expect the US sales to grow 21 '
            'percent on year to $170 million, driven by new launches and '

            'domestic formulation sales to decline 15 percent YoY on a high '
            'base. South Africa and Europe are seen registering a healthy YoY '
            'growth of 8 and 9 percent, respectively. The margins, however, '
            'are likely to witness a contraction due to the increase in raw '
            'material costs and also price erosion in generics business in the '
            "US. We expect Cipla's gross margin to erode by 180 bps YoY to "
            '60.6 percent owing to raw material inflation and US price '

            'higher R&D (research & development) (5.8 percent of sales) and '
            'SG&A spends, we expect 328 bps YoY fall in EBITDA margin to 21.2 '

{'article': 'The market consolidated further and ended the volatile session '

            'the big loss seen in the first session was recovered in the '

            'the other side, the weekly high near 17,800 is going to be a '
            'crucial hurdle in the coming sessions. Hence, the index is '
            'expected to trade within the range of 17,300-17,800 in short '
            'term, and if it decisively gives a close above the upper band of '
            'the said range, then there could be a move towards the '
            'psychological 18,000 mark, experts said. The BSE Sensex closed at '
            '58,803 and the Nifty50 at 17,540, down 0.1 percent each, on a '
            'week-on-week basis. However, the broader markets outperformed the '
            'frontliners as the Nifty Midcap 100 index gained nearly 1 percent '
            'and Smallcap 100 index rose 0.2 percent. Nifty50 on the weekly '
            'chart formed a long bull candle with an upper shadow as the '
            'closing was higher than the opening levels. "This pattern signals '
            'an emergence of a sustainable upside from the lows of 17,170. '
            'After reacting down from the important resistance of down trend '
            'line (connected from lower tops) at 17,900 levels in mid of '
            'August, the market has not showed any sharp down trended movement '
            'so far. The buying has emerged from the immediate supports," '
            'Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities '
            'said. The market expert expects the short term trend of Nifty to '
            'remain choppy. The market is now placed with in a broader high '
            'low range of 17,800-17,300 levels and the movement within this '
            'range is likely to continue for next week, he feels. One may '
            'expect selling pressure building from the highs around 17,800 '
            'levels and the buying is likely to emerge from the lows of 17,300 '
            'levels. Hence, the market action could be a buy on dips and sell '
            'on rise opportunity for near term, he advised. The stock had '
            'completed its corrective pattern in the month of June 2022 at Rs '
            '712. It was correcting the surprising move, which started at Rs '
            '500 in April 2021 and ended at Rs 1,020 in November 2021. For the '
            'past two months, the stock has been making higher bottoms between '
            'Rs 750 and Rs 800, indicating buying interest between specific '
            'levels. Over the past week, it seems that the stock has completed '
            'the last phase of correction and is ready to hit the first set of '
            'resistance, which is between Rs 880 to Rs 900. It is a good '
            'risk-to-reward ratio if we buy at current levels. Place stop-loss '
            'at Rs 790. Technically, since July 2021, the stock is forming a '
            '"rectangular consolidation" between Rs 430 and Rs 550 levels. '
            'After hitting the lower bound in the month of June 2022, it is '
            'bouncing back with an increase in volume. It is available with a '
            'great risk-to-reward ratio. Buy at current levels and place '
            'stop-loss at Rs 430 on a closing basis. Resistance will be at Rs '
            '480 and Rs 550. The stock is forming an ascending triangle at the '
            'bottom of the recent selloff. It is an indication that buyers are '
            'taking interest in the stock every fall and sellers are not in a '
            'hurry to sell the stock. They are selling at specific levels '
            'either at Rs 620 or Rs 638. We have seen in the past that such '
            'type of formation eventually ends with an upward break out as an '
            'aggressive buyer absorbs selling pressure, which is at a specific '
            'level. One can accumulate between Rs 610 and Rs 580 from a '
            'positional standpoint, with a stop-loss at Rs 560 and price '
            'target of Rs 700 and Rs 750. The attached weekly timeframe chart '
            'of Endurance Technologies indicates a larger consolidation '
            'pattern over the last 5-6 weeks. The stock price has witnessed a '
            'sharp upside breakout of this consolidation at Rs 1,470 levels '
            'last week and is now showing minor consolidation at the highs. '
            'The present action in the stock price signal a Bullish Flag '
            'Breakout at Rs 1,470, which is bullish continuation pattern. '
            'Weekly 14 period RSI (relative strength index) has placed at the '
            'edge of moving above upper 60 levels and volume has started to '
            'expand gradually during upside breakout in the stock price. This '
            'is positive indication and one may expect more upmove ahead. One '
            'can initiate buying in Endurance at current market price (Rs '
            '1,518.65), add more on dips down to Rs 1,465 and wait for the '
            'upside targets of Rs 1,650-1800 in the next 3-5 weeks, with a '
            'stop-loss of Rs 1,420. After showing a larger range movement in '
            'the last few months, the stock price is in the process of upside '
            'breakout of the range at Rs 240 levels. The weekly candle pattern '
            'indicates that the upside momentum could continue for the short '
            'term. The larger positive sequence like higher tops and bottoms '
            'is intact as per weekly timeframe chart. Volume has expanded on '
            'Friday during upside breakout and the weekly 14 period RSI shows '
            'positive indication. One may look to buy Welspun Corp at CMP (Rs '
            '241.3), add more on dips down to Rs 232 and wait for the upside '
            'targets of Rs 259-285 in the next 3-5 weeks. Place a stop-loss of '
            'Rs 225. The down trend of the last many months seems to have '
            'completed in this stock. The stock price is in an attempt to '
            'stage decisive upside reversal of down trend (type of triangle '
            'pattern) at Rs 153 levels. After showing a larger downward trend '
            'in the last many months, the stock price seems to have halted its '
            'down trend and recently showed an accumulation type pattern at '
            'the lows. This bullish action could indicate sustainable change '
            'in trend in the stock price towards upside. The volume has '
            'started to expand gradually and weekly 14 period RSI and weekly '
            'ADX/DMI (average directional index/directional movement index) '
            'signal chances of further strengthening of upside momentum for '
            'the stock price ahead. One may look to buy GEPIL at CMP (Rs 152), '
            'add more on dips down to Rs 145 and wait for the upside targets '
            'of Rs 165-180 in the next 3-5 weeks. Place a stop-loss of Rs 140. '
            'The stock had recently seen a consolidation which has led to '
            'formation of an Ascending Triangle pattern on the daily chart. '
            'The prices have now given a breakout from the pattern with good '
            'volumes. The RSI Smoothed oscillator has also given a positive '
            'crossover and is indicating a positive momentum. Hence, we expect '
            'further upmove in the stock in the short term. So traders can '
            'look to buy the stock around Rs 838 and look to add on dips '
            'towards Rs 826 for potential short term targets of Rs 880 and Rs '
            '905. The stop-loss on long positions should be placed below the '
            'support of Rs 800. After a decent upmove, the stock went through '
            'a corrective phase along with the broader markets since the month '
            'of October 2021. However, the stock has recovered from the lows '
            'in the last couple of months and has now given a breakout above '
            'its falling trendline resistance. Prices have also surpassed the '
            "'200 DEMA' (days exponential moving average) hurdle and closed "
            'above the same. The volumes are increasing gradually while the '
            'momentum setups are indicating a positive structure. Tinplate '
            'Company has corrected almost 34 percent from its top of Rs 438 '
            'which was registered on April 13, 2022. On weekly scale, it has '
            'taken support near its previous historical support zone Rs '
            '290-300. Since last one month it has made nice base near Rs 300 '
            'levels. Recently on daily scale, the stock confirmed a Bullish '
            'Inverted Hammer candlestick pattern exactly at the mentioned '
            'historical support and that is adding more confirmation of '
            'further upside in the counter. In addition to the above discussed '
            'technical reasoning, weekly RSI has nicely bounced back from 40 '
            'levels which is adding more strength in the said counter. Thus we '
            'advise traders to buy the stock for an upside target of Rs 375 '
            'with a stop-loss of Rs 285. The stock has corrected almost 35 '
            'percent from its top of Rs 774 which was made on August 30, 2021. '
            'From March 2 till August 12, it has been hovering near the '
            'crucial support zone of Rs 520-550. Recently on weekly scale the '
            'stock made Bullish Harami candlestick pattern along with volume '
            'picking up exactly near said support zone which is a possible '
            'sign of early reversal. Thus we advise traders to buy the stock '
            'for an upside target of Rs 650 with a stop-loss of Rs 538.',

{'article': "We had a pleasant start on September 12 taking the US market's "
            "previous Friday's rally into consideration. We challenged 18,000 "
            'but failed to sustain on the same day itself. But since it was '
            'merely a formality, the index opened beyond this psychological '
            'level on the following day. In this process, the Nifty registered '
            'a highest close in the last eight months. Everything looked hunky '
            'dory as we were poised to make a move towards previous highs. But '
            'the US markets tumbled suddenly on Tuesday on the back of rising '
            'inflation print. This resulted in a massive gap-down. Our '
            'markets, however, managed to weather the storm. We defended key '
            'levels and traded with a positive bias for couple of trading '
            "sessions. However, the Friday's session turned out to be a "
            'nightmare as we witnessed a sustained selling throughout the '
            'session to conclude the week with 1.70 percent cut, marginally '
            'above 17,500. Generally, we say Alls well that ends well but this '
            'time its the exact opposite. We had a perfect start of the week, '
            'but the end was certainly not everyone would have wished for. The '
            'broader structure remains bullish but with Nifty closing '
            'convincingly below 17,600 has dented the intermediate structure '
            'for sure. Pricewise, it resembles a Head and Shoulder pattern on '
            'daily time frame chart, which does not augur well for the bulls. '
            'If this pattern proves its significance, we may see further '
            'correction towards 17,200  17,000 in the coming week. But as of '
            'now, we do not want to fall into this camp. We would rather '
            'reassess the situation in the first half of the coming week. As '
            'far as support is concerned, 17,400 we are seeing as a key '
            'support. The moment we see Nifty sliding below it, we may see '
            'correction getting extended in the market. On the flipside, if '
            "Nifty has to find its mojo back, it needs to go beyond Friday's "
            'high of 17,820 on a closing basis. So meanwhile, any minor bounce '
            'back towards 17,650  17,750 should ideally be used to exit longs. '
            "After Friday's close, we would like to adopt a wait and watch "
            "approach and let's see how global market performs over the "
            "weekend. Traders are advised not to get intimidated by Friday's "
            'correction, rather keep a close tab on above mentioned scenarios. '
            'Also, one should avoid trading aggressively till the time market '
            'stabilizes from this turbulence. Sectorally, the recent leader, '
            'Bank Nifty is placed at an interesting juncture. Hopefully, it '
            'manages to lift the overall sentiments in the coming week. This '
            'has been our preferred bet of late from the liquor space. If we '
            'take a glance at the daily time frame chart, we can see nice base '
            'formation around Rs 760 odd levels. This was followed by small '
            'but steady up moves in regular intervals. In the week gone by, '
            'stock prices managed to confirm yet another breakout from the '
            'long multi-month trend line. This coincided with traversing of '
            "200-day SMA' (simple moving average) as well around Rs 838. "
            'Hence, although stock prices retraced a bit on Friday in tandem '
            'with broader market sell off, we recommend buying for a near term '
            'target of Rs 890. Traders can participate by following strict '

{'article': 'Bharat Petroleum Corporation is expected to report a 42 percent '
            'year-on-year decline in net profit to Rs 3,114.8 crore for the '
            'quarter ended March, according to a Moneycontrol poll. However, '

            'wave of the pandemic, saw marketing volumes surge on a sequential '
            'and on-year basis. That said, BPCL was unable to reap the '

            'prices of retail fuel for majority of the quarter even as global '
            'crude oil prices simmered. During the quarter, global crude oil '
            'prices rallied more than 30 percent aided by a strong demand '
            'environment in the West and sanctions imposed on Russian oil '
            'exports following the countrys invasion of Ukraine in late '
            'February. The high oil marketing business losses will reflect in '

            'is likely to fall 12 percent on a year-on-year basis to Rs 5,107 '
            'crore in the March quarter. The decline in operating profits is '
            'despite Singapore Gross Refining Margins soaring during the '
            'quarter due to tight refining supplies and strong demand '
            'environment. Kotak Institutional Equities expects reported '

{'article': 'The equity market had a cautious start to the week gone by after '
            'an extended weekend but as buying gathered pace, the Nifty '
            'managed to go past the psychological mark of 18,000. On August '
            '19, however, the market had a muted opening and soon key indices '
            'tanked. With some consolidation in the later hours, the Nifty '
            'ended at around 17,750, down more than a percent, trimming most '
            'of the gains made during the week. With indices snapping their '
            'eight-day winning streak, the market is in for a volatile run in '
            'the monthly expiry week. From a technical point of view, the '
            'large bearish candle formed on August 19 has engulfed the '
            "previous three sessions' price movement, which is a sign of "
            'weakness. The index also closed below the five-day exponential '
            'moving average (EMA) for the first time since July 26. Hence, in '
            'the first half of the week, any bounce towards 17,80017,875 is '
            'likely to get sold into. Traders are advised to lighten up longs '
            'and stay on the sidelines for a while. Aggressive traders can '
            'look to initiate bearish bets by keeping a strict exit strategy '
            'beyond 18,000. If we see some nervousness globally, the Nifty can '
            'test 17,600 17,450. The overall trend, however, remains strongly '
            'bullish but since the index has rallied vertically from 16,400, '
            'profit booking is likely during the week. This view remains valid '
            'as long as the 18,000 mark is not breached on a sustainable '
            'basis. The decline should be considered healthy for the next leg '
            'of the rally and used to go long. Trades are advised to keep a '
            'close tab on these scenarios and continue with a stock-specific '
            'approach. Towards the later half of June, the stock made a bottom '
            'around Rs 850 and then witnessed a vertical move for nearly four '
            'weeks. This was followed by long consolidation as prices rested '
            'firmly above the 200-simple moving average (SMA). On August 18, '
            'the stock finally managed to confirm a decisive breakout from the '
            'recent congestion zone. The price configuration can be termed as '
            'a "Bullish Flag" pattern known for its faster moves. Considering '
            'the higher volumes, we recommend buying for a near-term target of '
            'Rs 1,330. Traders can participate by following strict stop-loss '
            'at Rs 1,181. The automobile space has been the rank outperformer '
            'in the recent rally and TVS Motor is one of the biggest '
            'contributors over the last two months. The stock price has zoomed '
            'more than 50 percent in a quick succession. The trend remains '
            'strongly bullish but before entering a four-digit league, the '
            'stock prices can undergo some profit-booking due to extreme '
            'overbought condition of multiple indicators. Purely with a '
            'trading view, we expect some profit-booking in the coming week. '
            'Traders are advised to sell on a bounce for a near-term target of '

            'Rs 8,393 crore from the revenues of Rs 5,487 crore during the '

            'to Rs 941 crore as compared to an EBITDA of Rs 515 crore for the '
            'same period last year. The EBITDA margins for the quarter at 11.2 '
            'percent remained flat on the sequential basis. As the country '
            'enters the festive season, we expect the 2 wheeler demand to be '

            'growth in its volumes during the month of September as compared '
            'to the same period last year. On a MoM basis though, its growth '

            'expected to clock double-digit growth MoM which is likely to be '

            'the economy segment of 2W, said Kripashankar Maurya, assistant '
            'vice presidentofChoice Equities. The entry and executive '
            'motorcycle segment had been sluggish lately. With a predominantly '
            'normal monsoon, sentiments in rural economy are seen turning '
            'around for good and an uptick in demand is starting to be seen. '
            'Driven by positive rural sentiments, new launches and attractive '
            'sales schemes ahead of the festive season, we expect 2W volumes '
            'to recover, said a report from Sharekhan by BNP Paribas. The '

            'MoM volume growth of 4-5 percent while growth compared to the '
            'same period last year is expected to be close to triple digits '
            'for both Maruti and M&M. Tata Motors is expected to report MoM '

            'the CV sector is expected to continue for the next 3-5 years, '

            '5.2 percent MoM), and   6,250 units (up 3 percent MoM) in '
            'September 2022. Light commercial vehicles are expected to do well '

{'article': 'A power play seems to bebuilding up quietly in the '
            'Indianmarketsas the country sees its demand for electricity '
            'shootingup by 8 percent in FY22 and 17 percent so far this '
            'fiscal. The heat wave during the summer caused an extraordinary '
            'spike this year, especially in peak demand. While earlier demand '
            'used to shift towards commercial establishments during the day '
            'time and towards residential in the evenings and nights, the '
            'work-from-home and hybrid culture is creating day-time demand in '
            'residential areas as well. Further, as the GDP growth '
            'accelerates, the power demand is likely to grow in tandem. '
            'Experts believe that the proliferation of electric vehicles (EV), '
            'a steady push towards renewables and a high capex cycle would '
            'continue to make the sector a huge investment opportunity. The '
            'Indian power sector would be a huge growth vector and would be '
            'instrumental in Indias growth story in the next two decades based '
            'on both consumption patterns and government initiatives to boost '
            'production and supply, said Anand Varadarajan, Directorof Asit C '
            'Mehta Financial Services. Stocks like , , , , have been on a roll '
            'over the last few months, probably due to the cooling of the '
            'global coal prices and revival of industrial demand. If the '
            'demand remains robust and the commodity prices do not flare up '
            'again the power sector will be extremely attractive, Sonam '
            'Srivastava, Founderof Wright Research, said. For a growing '
            'economy like India, power plays the role played by oxygen in '
            'humans. Having enough power to run the engines of the economy and '
            'to meet the requirements of the domestic households is of utmost '
            'importance. Power deficit cripples industrial activity as well as '
            'the household budgets. The power deficit has still not gone to '
            'the 8-10 percent range which was typical in 2009-2013,pointed out '
            'Vikas V Gupta, CEO and Chief Investment Strategistat OmniScience '
            'Capital. The power sector has its set of structural challenges '
            'that it has struggled with for decades. There is a lot of '
            'inefficiency in the supply side due to distribution, and payables '
            'have accumulated due to non-payment of dues. On the other hand, '
            'the demand has continuously risen due to growing industry and '
            'household consumptions. India is re-entering an era of peak power '
            'deficit due to under-investment in power generation capacity in '
            'the past decade, Mittul Kalawadia, Fund Manager, ICICI Prudential '
            'Mutual Fund, had said in a recent interview with  . It is quite '
            'possible that the power demand grows at a much faster pace '
            'compared to new capacity coming online. This could create a huge '
            'deficit and thus higher power prices for a short period of time. '
            'However, one should keep in mind that there is significant capex '
            'work in progress by various power generation companies," Gupta '
            'said. This will augment power supply in the near future. We dont '
            'think that India is entering in any kind of power shortage '
            'scenario because the cost per unit of renewable electricity '
            '(solar) has come down drastically over the last half a decade, '
            'said Raj Vyas, Portfolio Manager, Teji Mandi. Hence, any kind of '
            'surge in peak demand can easily be met with Indias current target '
            'of solar power generation capacity. Also, the gestation period '
            'for solar power plant is much less compared to traditional '
            'thermal energy which will help in meeting the required power '
            'deficit. Vikram V, VP and Sector Head, ICRA, concurred and said '
            'that India has sufficient capacity to meet its peak demand and '
            'any shortage of thermal power can be met with additional capacity '
            'additions in renewable energy that are steadily coming online. '
            'Large capex is going on in the power generation space. Except for '
            'the discoms, the rest of the power sector is growing at a fast '
            'pace, Gupta said. According to the NIP (National Infrastructure '
            'Pipeline), the target capital expenditure for the power sector is '
            'Rs 14 lakh crore, which shall provide a significantly large Total '
            'Addressable Market (TAM) for the power companies. The financial '
            'health of the distribution companies (discoms) generally is very '
            'poor which is being reflected in their outstanding dues of more '
            'than Rs. 1.5 lakh crore payable by them to generating companies. '
            'T&D (transmissionand distribution) losses and subsidised or free '
            'power are the key reasons for this, said Deepak Jasani, Head of '
            'Retail Research, HDFC Securities. Privatisation of Discoms and '
            'incentivizing private investment in the sector are steps in the '
            'right direction but have been met with resistance from various '
            'sections. While reforms have been taken to address the '
            'challenges, implementation of these reforms will be a key '
            'monitorable, Jasani said. The reforms opened the sector to '
            'private participation and countered years of sluggish expansion '
            'of generation and transmission, which had not kept pace with '
            'growth in electricity demand. The competitive framework supported '
            'a significant increase in the addition of thermal power plants '
            'and renewables while the transmission grid was unified into a '
            'national grid, said Vikram Kasat- Head Advisory, Prabhudas '
            'Lilladher Pvt Ltd. The newly introduced Electricity Bill allows '
            'multiple discoms to operate in a given area which might increase '
            'competition and bring efficiency in prices. But, this is met with '
            'resistance from various state governments and state electricity '
            'boards, said Srivastava. With various schemes, penalties and '
            'incentives the government is trying to get the discoms into a '
            'healthier shape. The most notable revamp scheme for the '
            'distribution sector involves an outlay of over Rs 3 lakh crore '
            'for providing financial assistance to discoms for modernising and '
            'strengthening the distribution infrastructure. The discoms are '
            'also getting penalized for not getting their act right. The Power '
            'System Operation Corp (POSOCO) has barred 27 power distribution '
            'companies (discoms) from buying electricity from power exchanges '
            'to meet their short-term requirements, said Vinit Bolinjkar, Head '
            'of Research at Ventura Securities. In a letter to the exchanges '
            'on August 19, POSOCO invoked the Electricity (Late Payment '
            'Surcharge and Related Matters) Rules, 2022, after utilities in 13 '
            'states failed to clear Rs 5,085 crore in dues owed to electricity '
            'generating companies (gencos). Another key aspect based on which '
            'the discoms can improve their performance is havingpower purchase '
            'agreements (PPAs) in place. "The discoms should plan their '
            'procurement and sign PPAs to manage the demand growthwhich would '
            'improve the visibility on revenues for Thermal GENCOs, which do '
            'not have PPAs currently", added Vikram V of ICRA. According to a '
            'report from global research firm Jefferies, there are five likely '
            'triggers that will play out for the power sector in the next 5-8 '
            'years. Renewable energy (RE) capacity rising 82percent by FY26-27 '
            'and 2.8x by FY30; thermal capex revival; transmission capex CAGR '
            'of 15percent-plusagainstless than 5 percent in the last five '
            'years; Policy, especially distribution, being a game changer and '
            'green hydrogen ramp-up, it said. Renewable energy is one of the '
            'strongest growth vectors in power, with India planning to grow '
            'its renewable energy capacity from the current nearly 150 GW to '
            '450 GW by 2030. India ranks third in the RE attractive index 2021 '
            'and the government has set an ambitious target to achieve a '
            'capacity of 175 GW by the end of 2022 and we believe that there '
            'is great opportunity for growth going ahead, said Vyas of Teji '
            'Mandi. The proliferation of Electric Vehicles (EV) in India also '
            'presents a huge opportunity in the power sector. The sector is '
            'expected to see robust growth with the governments several policy '
            "reforms and the 'Make in India' initiative which is expected to "
            'result in increased per-capita consumption of power in India '
            'which is still significantly low compared to the global average, '
            'said Varadarajan. Experts suggest investors to focus on stocks '
            'such as  ,  , and   for the coming 8-12 months. They are of the '
            'opinion that  ,  ,   and   also have substantial upsides from '
